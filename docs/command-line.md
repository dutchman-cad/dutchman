# The command line

Everything the desktop app does is also a command. `dutchman convert --help` lists every option.

## Output files

Omit the output to write beside the input, using its stem and the extension chosen by
`--to`: `.sc` (default), `.FCMacro`, or `.FCStd` for model output.
Targets before SolidCraft 0.25.1 get `.solidcraft` by default.
`--to dxf` writes one `part-PageName.dxf` per TechDraw page; see
[TechDraw drawing output](freecad.md#techdraw-to-dxf). If a model default exists, Dutchman
exits 2 without changing it: choose `-o PATH` or pass `--force` to replace it. A default
that is the input itself is always refused. `--force` conflicts with `--no-clobber`.
Explicit output paths are replaced unless `--no-clobber` is given. Built-in commands win
over files with the same name; use `dutchman convert pilot` for a file named `pilot`.
Installed tools take precedence over bare files; otherwise an existing file or a recognised
CAD extension selects conversion.

## Options

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--preset fast`, `--preset standard`, `--preset full` | What to keep; Standard is the default. See [Choosing what to keep](presets.md). |
| `--no-history`, `--import-only` | Leave feature history out; keep geometry and the preset's reference sketches. |
| `--no-sketches` | Leave reference sketches out; sketches needed by retained history stay. |
| `--no-joints` | Leave assembly joints out and retain stored placements. |
| `--no-memory-check` | Bypass the memory refusal and Standard's history budget. |
| `--yes` | Never prompt to switch presets; refuse an over-budget conversion with exit 2. |
| `--solidcraft PATH` | The `solidcraft-cli` that checks a converted history. Default: `$SOLIDCRAFT_CLI`, else `solidcraft-cli` on `PATH`, else the one inside an installed SolidCraft app (macOS `SolidCraft*.app`, newest first; Windows `Program Files\SolidCraft`, else the install folder recorded in the registry). |
| `--solidcraft-version x.y.z` | Target SolidCraft release, at least 0.18.2. Default: the found CLI's version capped at newest known, even with `--no-verify`, else the newest known at build time (currently 0.27). |
| `--no-verify` | Write the history without checking it in SolidCraft. Cannot be combined with `--solidcraft`. |
| `--verify-timeout SECONDS` | How long each SolidCraft check may run before the history is written unverified. Default 120. |
| `--no-clobber` | Do not replace an existing `.sc` file: that file's conversion fails instead. By default it is replaced. |
| `--project DIR` | The project folder an assembly's part files are searched in when they are not at their stored paths. Default: the nearest folder above the assembly holding an `.ipj`, else two folders up. See [Finding the part files](inventor.md#finding-the-part-files). |
| `--search DIR` | Another folder to search for part files the project folder does not hold, such as a shared library. May be given more than once. |
| `-o PATH`, `--force` | Write to `PATH`; `--force` replaces an existing default output (see [Output files](#output-files)). |
| `--to freecad`, `--to fcstd`, `--to dxf` | Write a FreeCAD macro or document, or TechDraw pages as DXF (see [FreeCAD](freecad.md)). |
| `--threads N` | Bound the assembly part workers; `1` is serial (see [Assembly workers](#assembly-workers)). |
| `--diagnostics`, `--diagnostics-default` | Write an anonymous diagnostic log while converting (see [Diagnostic logs](troubleshooting.md#diagnostic-logs-for-unfinished-runs)). |
| `--json` | One final JSON report on stdout, with progress JSON lines on stderr. |
| `--quiet` | Hide conversion progress and the volunteer invitation. |
| `--verbose` | Print every loss, each note in full. Without it, a file with more than 12 losses is summarised by component (below), repeated notes of the same kind are grouped with a count, and long notes are cut to their first sentence. The JSON report always has them all in full. |
| `--log FILE` | Also write the whole text report, every loss in full, grouped by component, to `FILE`. |

## Look before you convert: inspect

`inspect` reads a file and says what converting it would carry across. It writes nothing and
does not run SolidCraft.

`design_sketch_constraints.f3d`, from the test fixtures folder ([crates/dutchman-core/tests/fixtures/](../crates/dutchman-core/tests/fixtures/)), is for inspecting only: its history is a
single sketch, with no solid or surface to convert.

```sh
dutchman inspect design_sketch_constraints.f3d
```

```text
Fusion archive (.f3d): 1 body, 1 face
would write: nothing; converting it fails: the model has no solids or surfaces SolidCraft can import
  mapped     sketch "Sketch 1"
dutchman: Degraded: f3d/feature.edge-reference-lost: 1 source parametric edge reference(s) were marked EDGE_REFERENCE_LOST and have no independent complete selection proof.
dutchman: Degraded: f3d/sketch.relation-native: 2 sketch relation(s) retain native operands because no unique neutral relation was resolved.
dutchman: Degraded: f3d/sketch.dimension-native: 1 sketch dimension(s) retain native operands because no unique neutral dimension was resolved.
```

The first line counts the bodies and faces read. The second says whether the design would keep
its feature history or be written as geometry, and why, or, as here, that converting it would
fail and why. Then comes each feature of the history
with its status (`mapped`, `not_needed`, `left_out` or `blocked`, with the reason for a
blocked one), and the loss report. `inspect --json` prints the same as a
`dutchman.inspect/1` report.

## Progress during conversion

`convert`, `convert-all`, `inspect`, and `watch` show the current stage, designs read, and
elapsed time on stderr, in seconds and, past a minute, also in hours and minutes, such as
`7261 s (2 h 1 min)`; the desktop app shows the same. A terminal gets one updating line; redirected stderr gets a line at
each stage or design completion and a still-working line every five seconds. `--quiet`
suppresses progress. With `--json`, stderr contains `dutchman.progress/1` JSON lines; stdout
stays one final report (or the existing watch-event stream for `watch`). Elapsed time starts
with each file, including a separate assembly's part files.

The desktop app shows these updates on each converting file's card. When the design total
is known it shows a determinate bar for designs read; otherwise it keeps a spinner alongside
the stage and elapsed time. The bar measures reading designs, not the remaining conversion time.
Stage ids are `input` (opening the input and finding part files), `decode` (reading geometry and history), `project`
(checking the decoded model), `map` (building and checking the output design), and `write`
(saving the output). A model-check fallback can return to `decode` to read geometry alone.
A heartbeat confirms the worker is running; it does not measure decoder activity.

Fusion `.f3z` archives are decoded in one call. Member decode attempts can repeat, so
progress does not infer unique design counts or a percentage from them. Optional
[diagnostic logs](troubleshooting.md#diagnostic-logs-for-unfinished-runs) record these attempts. Separate assembly part files report completions as they are read,
with an unknown total while parts are discovered. These updates do not change the final report.

## Convert a whole folder: convert-all

`convert-all` converts every file named, and every file Dutchman knows inside the folders
named (with their subfolders; symbolic links are not followed). The designs go to
`--out-dir`, keeping the folder layout. A file that fails does not stop the others.

```sh
dutchman convert-all --jobs 2 --out-dir converted project
```

```text

Each converted file's loss report is listed beneath it, summarised by component when it has
more than 12 losses. The whole report, every loss in full, is written to `dutchman.log` in the
output folder (`--log FILE` puts it elsewhere). This log, ordinary JSON, and the journal hold
file names and paths; keep them private. For an issue, request `--report-anon FILE`, review
it, and share that report as [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) shows. Files in the folders that are not in
a format Dutchman knows (`notes.txt`, say) are skipped and counted at the end. The exit code is 0
only when every file converted, else 1. `--jobs N` sets how many files
convert at once (default: the machine's cores, at most 8). It takes the same options as
`convert`, and `--json` prints one `dutchman.convert-all/1` report holding a
`dutchman.convert/1` report per file. One run converts at most 10,000 files and searches
folders at most 32 levels deep.

Large batches:

- **Each file in its own process.** A file that takes longer than `--timeout SECONDS` (default
  900) or holds more than `--max-memory MB` (default 8192; `0` for no limit) is stopped and
  reported as failed, and the rest carry on. A file that crashes the converter fails alone.
- **Carry on where you stopped.** `--journal FILE` records each file's result as it finishes.
  Run the same command again and the files already recorded, unchanged since, are not
  converted again; their results come from the journal. Files another version of Dutchman
  recorded, or an older journal format (before 0.1.4), are converted again.
- **A report you can share.** `--report-anon FILE` also writes an anonymous report: counts by
  format, every loss and failure by cause and stage, and timings, with no file names, paths or
  geometry. See [Testing Dutchman on your library](testing-your-library.md) and
  [the report's fields](report-anon.md).

Everything runs on your machine: Dutchman makes no network connections.

FreeCAD assemblies can link Bodies and Parts in sibling `.FCStd` documents. Dutchman
tries the assembly's folder first, then the same project and `--search` folders used for
Inventor below. Missing linked files become named losses while the available parts convert.
Link arrays place each element once; grounded parts stay fixed. See [FreeCAD](freecad.md).

For an Inventor assembly (`.iam`), Dutchman finds its part files as Inventor does: at the
paths it stores, else anywhere under the project folder, the nearest folder above it holding a
`.ipj`. Give another with `--project DIR`; `convert-all` searches each folder it is given. See
[Finding the part files](inventor.md#finding-the-part-files).

## Watch a folder

```sh
dutchman watch /mnt/inbox --out-dir /mnt/converted
# One scan for cron (files modified within the last 10 seconds wait for the next run):
dutchman watch /mnt/inbox --out-dir /mnt/converted --once
```

The watcher polls recursively every `--interval` seconds (default 5), keeping relative
folders in the output. It ignores hidden files and folders, `~$*`, `*.part`, `*.tmp`,
`*.crdownload`, unknown formats and symbolic links. Like `convert-all`, it selects the
newest numbered `.prt.N` save and derives its output from the base part name. Same-stem
inputs in one scan receive numbered output names as in `convert-all`.

A file is ready after its size and modification time stay unchanged for `--settle`
seconds (default 10), counted from when the watcher first sees it: a copy can keep its
source's old modification time (Finder, `cp -p`, `rsync -t`), so that time alone does not
mean the copy has finished. With `--once`, which looks only once, a file is ready when its
modification time is at least `--settle` seconds old; future timestamps always wait. Use
`--settle 0` for files already uploaded.
The inbox is only read: mount it read-only in a container if desired. Choose a separate
output folder, with neither folder inside the other and no symbolic links in output subfolders.

Each conversion runs in the existing isolated batch worker. `--jobs` defaults to the
machine's cores, at most 8. `--timeout` defaults to 900 seconds per file, and
`--max-memory` to 8192 MB (0 disables the memory limit). The same conversion options as
`convert-all` apply, including `--to`, `--import-only`, `--no-verify`, `--solidcraft`, `--solidcraft-version`,
`--project` and `--search`.

For `parts/cube.f3d`, the default results are `parts/cube.sc` and
`parts/cube.report.json` under the output folder. Failures write `parts/cube.failed.json`
there, with the ordinary `dutchman.convert/1` error report. A failed update keeps the
previous design. Successful updates replace the design and report; obsolete report sidecars
are removed only when they still contain the watcher's bytes. Unrelated or externally
edited outputs and sidecars are skipped, as are destinations assigned to another input. `--no-clobber` also keeps existing watcher outputs.

The output folder's `.dutchman-watch.json` records SHA-256 input hashes and outcomes,
plus hashes proving which outputs the watcher owns. It is saved by temporary file and
atomic rename after each result. Recorded content is never retried, including failures
and skips, across restarts and option changes. Keep this state with the outputs; choose a
fresh output folder to retry unchanged files. Run one watcher per output folder.

Each result prints one line with `converted`, `failed`, or `skipped`, a relative input path
and duration. `--json` prints one `dutchman.watch-event/1` object per line instead (see
[JSON reports](json.md)). Hash skips and ignored or unsettled files print nothing.
`--once` scans once, drains all ready work, then exits 0 if no attempted conversions failed,
or 1 otherwise. A previous failure remembered in state does not fail a new run. Ctrl-C or
SIGTERM stops scanning and starting queued work, gives running conversions up to 30 seconds
to finish (their per-file limits still apply), saves state and exits. Inputs changed during
a conversion are skipped without recording that hash, then settled again on a later scan.

## Assembly workers

`convert`, `convert-all`, and `watch` accept `--threads N` for assembly part work. `0` (the default) uses available CPU parallelism; `1` runs the
serial path. The actual count is limited by the number of leaf parts and free memory,
using the largest part's CADIR body count to estimate temporary memory, with a floor
for mapping and a SolidCraft check process. Workers share only the memory that stays free
after a quarter of it (at least 1 GiB) is kept back for the rest of the conversion. The core precomputes component slices and
reuses an identical empty model for assembly holders, then builds the tree in its
original order. SolidCraft STEP restatement, history mapping, blend proving, and per-part
replay checks prepare independently. Parts then enter the design in source order, keeping
IDs, names, blobs, losses, and history records identical. Failed worker preparations are
retried serially at their original positions.

```sh
dutchman convert assembly.f3z assembly.sc --threads 4
dutchman convert-all project/ --out-dir converted/ --threads 1
```

`--jobs` limits simultaneous files in a batch; `--threads` limits part workers within
each file. Account for both when tuning memory use. Native decoding remains serial.
Other writers use the shared slicing stage only. The JSON report's `threads` field records the
requested limit and the number of workers used. `--no-memory-check` does not disable
the part-worker cap.

## SolidCraft versions

Dutchman is made for the current SolidCraft (any release from the last two weeks);
older versions get simplified features, or pass `--solidcraft-version x.y.z` on
`convert`, `convert-all`, or `watch` (at least 0.18.2).
The target defaults to the found CLI's version, even with `--no-verify`, else the
newest minor known at build time (currently 0.27). The current window is 0.18–0.27.
Constant-radius FreeCAD helices keep editable sketch-profile coils only for targets
0.25 patch 1 or newer; older targets preserve the original geometry and report the version needed.
SolidCraft names and status comparisons use minors; patch-sensitive writer gates use full
versions internally. CI tests the
latest published patch of the newest minor, while the oldest window release stays pinned.
Designs open in their target release and newer releases.


SolidCraft conversion reports include the selected target and the discovered CLI version,
even with verification off. Text output includes `Target SolidCraft 0.27 (found 0.27.1)`,
or `(none found)` when no version can be read. `--solidcraft-version` overrides the target;
otherwise the found supported version is used, capped at the newest known release, falling
back to 0.27. Successful conversions print the same installed-version notice beside the
target line, with the SolidCraft download URL for too-old releases. The CLI never checks
for Dutchman updates over the network. Failed or refused files print neither line.
No installed release means no notice. Other output
formats omit this line and the JSON `solidcraft` object.

CLI version discovery runs at most once per resolved CLI path in each Dutchman process,
including when the CLI gives no answer. The version command has a three-second limit.
Successful versions are also cached across runs in `solidcraft-versions.json` under
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/dutchman` (or `~/.cache/dutchman`) on Linux,
`~/Library/Caches/Dutchman` on macOS, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dutchman` on Windows.
The disk entry must match the CLI's resolved path, file size, and modification time;
changing the executable causes a fresh probe in the next process. Unreadable or damaged
caches are ignored, and timeouts are remembered only for the current process.
With an explicit target (`--solidcraft-version` or the desktop target selector) and
verification off, Dutchman does not run the version command. Reports reuse a matching
cached version, or leave `solidcraft.found` null when it has not been checked.

## Other Dutchman CAD tools

Install `dutchman-pilot` or `dutchman-fixtures` next to `dutchman` or on `PATH`; the copy
next to `dutchman` wins. `dutchman --help` (or `dutchman` alone) lists installed tools with
their versions. An installed Pilot receives its arguments unchanged, taking precedence over
the built-in Pilot. Without it, builds with the default `pilot` feature use the built-in
Pilot; other missing tools print their installation link and exit 1.

`dutchman printers` and `dutchman print FILE --printer ID` run [Dutchman Print](https://github.com/dutchman-cad/print),
`dutchman-print`, when it is installed.

Pilot-only installations can ship the small `dutchman-launcher` binary renamed to `dutchman`.
It runs installed tools and identifies itself as `dutchman launcher <version>` with
`--version`. Get [Dutchman Convert](https://github.com/dutchman-cad/dutchman) for `convert`,
`convert-all`, `watch`, `inspect`, and `formats`.
