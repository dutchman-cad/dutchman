# Choosing what to keep

`convert`, `convert-all`, and `watch` accept these presets and narrowing switches:

| Preset | SolidCraft output |
|---|---|
| `fast` | Geometry at the stored placements; no history, reference sketches, or joints. No memory refusal. |
| `standard` (default) | History, sketches, and joints. History is left out when its estimate exceeds free memory and the history-free estimate fits. |
| `full` | History, sketches, and joints whenever they map; history is never left out to fit memory. |

Parameters that map are retained with history or reference sketches; Fast leaves them out.

`--no-history` (also `--import-only`), `--no-sketches`, and `--no-joints` only remove
choices from the preset. `--no-sketches` removes reference sketches, including those
kept beside an imported shape or after a blocked history; sketches needed to replay
retained history stay. `--no-joints` omits assembly joints and restores the source's
stored placements. An Info line under `joints` records that choice.
FreeCAD output (`--to freecad` or `--to fcstd`) honours the history choice only;
the sketch and joint choices do not control that writer.

```sh
dutchman convert assembly.f3z assembly.sc --preset fast
dutchman convert part.ipt part.sc --preset full --no-sketches
dutchman convert-all project/ --out-dir converted/ --preset standard --yes
```

Text conversions show `Estimate: about N GB (±R %), about M min (±T %)` before converting,
unless `--quiet` is set. Estimates below 0.1 GB read `under 0.1 GB`, and times below
60 seconds read `under a minute`; longer times round up to whole minutes. Where measurements
don't yet support a time band for the format, the time reads `roughly M min`.
Estimates use file size and format. A bounded ZIP pre-read counts members and total
uncompressed content for `.f3d`, `.f3z` and `.FCStd`. Fusion archives also read each
embedded design’s directory, one design at a time, without decoding it. Separate assembly
part files are not pre-read. Unknown formats, unreadable metadata, ZIP directories over
10,000 members or 16 MiB, and unreadable archives have no estimate.

## Memory and time model

Fusion, Inventor parts and SolidWorks parts have three separately measured costs:
reading through native decode, conversion after decode, and checking. Conversion includes
validation, visibility filtering, component extraction, mapping and writing. The read
figure is its peak; conversion and checking figures are extra memory above the preceding
peak. Their memory and time add to the total shown in the desktop box and file row.
History on/off have independent conversion and checking models. Geometry-only conversion
also checks its converted shape unless `--no-verify` is selected.

Memory is `fixed MB + content bytes × B/B + member count × MB/member` after converting
MB to bytes. A fitted content plateau, where listed, limits only the variable memory
cost. It is an empirical estimate, not a ceiling on allocations. Time is `fixed seconds +
content MiB × s/MiB + member count × s/member`. All coefficients live in `COEFFICIENTS`
in `crates/dutchman/src/choices.rs`. Decimal MB/GB are used for memory; MiB is 1,048,576
bytes. Fractional phase times add before `seconds` rounds up.

| Format | Stage | Fixed MB | B/B | MB/member | Content plateau MB | Fixed s | s/MiB | s/member |

## Calibration and misses

The current shared-index main build was measured on six public Fusion assemblies
(Voron V1.8, Voron V2.4, Cascade, v02, RailCore and Trident) and five smaller public or
synthetic Fusion, Inventor and SolidWorks parts. The 44 successful observations pair
Full with checking on/off and Standard without history with checking on/off. Runs used
Linux, four requested workers, SolidCraft 0.30.1, the default 120-second per-check timeout,
`nice -n 10`, and a 24 GiB per-process address-space limit, one conversion at a time.
The recorded costs include checks that reached that timeout. Whole-tree peaks use
simultaneous resident memory, bounded below by the largest individual high-water mark;
individual high-water marks are never summed. Read boundaries come from the decoder’s
end marker. Sampling was 200 ms for assemblies and 2 ms for small parts, with diagnostic
clock alignment on the repeated small cases. Signed checked-minus-unchecked differences
are preserved; negative differences contribute zero added memory.

Single-design Fusion adds member count only where leaving one file out improves weighted
fit error by at least 10%. Read and conversion fits use relative errors with 20 MB /
5-second denominator floors. The two multipart assemblies support one content slope per
metric and the measured small Fusion floor; their time fit minimizes absolute seconds.
Checking uses a measured small-file floor and absolute errors, with a capped memory ramp
where the assembly observations support a plateau.

Inventor and SolidWorks each have one measured small shape. Those measurements calibrate
fixed costs only. Their old total content growth remains a heuristic for larger parts:
25 B/B without history, 50 B/B for Inventor with history, and 42.5 B/B for SolidWorks with
history, partitioned across reading and conversion. Larger foreign-part check times have
no measured content growth. FreeCAD retains its combined model: 29 MB plus 150 B/B, with
a 1.04 history multiplier on content and its previous startup terms. Other unmeasured
formats retain combined heuristics.

The largest absolute misses after rounding the coefficients are:

| Fit | Peak-memory miss | Time miss |
|---|---:|---:|
| Read | 0.806 GB (v18) | 61.2 s (v18) |
| Convert, history off | 2.980 GB (trident) | 24.7 s (cascade) |
| Convert, history on | 2.288 GB (v18) | 83.6 s (v24) |
| Check, history on | 1.810 GB (v24) | 131.7 s (railcore) |
| Check, history off | 1.857 GB (railcore) | 95.5 s (cascade) |

Total-peak memory envelopes for this Fusion corpus are ±45% for `.f3d` and ±30% for
`.f3z`, adding one percentage point and rounding up to 5%. These bands describe total
peak memory, not each individual stage. Inventor and SolidWorks use a ±100% heuristic
outside their measured small-file floors; FreeCAD keeps ±50%. These are not guarantees
for unseen designs. Checking depends on the geometry and applicable history, which ZIP
sizes cannot reveal. Time bands remain uncalibrated (`time_band: null`), so longer times
read as rough. Other platforms, worker counts and timeout settings have no fresh timing
calibration. The old multipart serial-fraction speedup is not reused after the performance
change; changing threads does not invent a measured speedup. Actual worker limits and
buffer budgets are unchanged.

`peak_bytes`, `seconds`, `seconds_exact`, `band`, `memory_band` and `time_band` keep their
existing JSON fields. No split fields are added. The estimator never runs SolidCraft or
decodes a design. Version discovery before conversion can still run with `--no-verify`;
a possible probe timeout is not normal conversion work.

`threads.used` is the largest bounded Dutchman part-worker limit selected across conversion
stages and embedded members. It excludes threads inside SolidCraft child processes and does
not measure simultaneously busy CPU cores. Failed worker tasks can retry serially.

Available memory comes from Linux `MemAvailable` bounded by remaining cgroup v2
headroom (including ancestor limits), or safe system APIs through sysinfo on macOS and
Windows. Memory probes do not launch subprocesses. Unknown memory or an unknown estimate
does not block a run. Estimates use decimal GB and are approximate, not
reservations; other processes and simultaneous conversions can change available memory.

The memory check runs before decoding, using only the pre-read estimate. Standard
leaves history out for any design whose history estimate exceeds free memory when
its history-free estimate fits. That retention decision stays fixed through conversion.
After reading, a conversion can also stop when the resident design leaves too little
memory for mapping and writing. Full refuses before decode when its estimate
exceeds free memory. When Standard removes history, one Info line under `history` says:

```text
feature history left out: this conversion needs about N GB with history and M GB are free; use the full preset to keep it
```

If the selected choices exceed free memory, an interactive terminal offers the next
lighter preset and asks `y/N`; only `y` or `yes` switches. Without a terminal, with
`--yes`, or with `--json`, the conversion refuses with exit 2 and this message:

```text
this conversion needs about N GB and M GB are free; try --preset <lighter> (or --no-memory-check to run anyway)
```

`--yes` means no interactive preset switch. It does not bypass the memory guard.
`--no-memory-check` bypasses the refusal, Standard's automatic history budget, and
history-check skipping.
Existing decoder input limits and batch worker memory limits still apply. Batch
conversion checks each input; changing presets or narrowing switches also prevents a
journal from reusing a result made with different choices.

The desktop memory dialog uses the same preset descriptions as its main selector and lets
you narrow these choices before proceeding. Its total and the file row include checking only
when a SolidCraft CLI was found and checking is on. They show Standard's reduced estimate
when history is left out to fit. Checkbox costs come from the estimator; choices without a
separate model show **no separate estimate**. See [the desktop guide](desktop.md).

## Checking after reading

The presets, narrowing switches, and memory guard are described above; `dutchman convert --help` lists them too.

Checking stays enabled by default, independently of retention. It checks imported geometry
when feature history is off. The peak estimate includes the requested check. Conversion
preflight and Standard’s history budget compare conversion-only memory with free memory;
selecting one part compares the calibrated read figure because the whole file must be read.

The runtime guard uses the same calibrated extra check figure shown by the desktop. It
does not multiply the memory already held by the decoded model. Free memory is measured
after reading and checked again before replay. If the allowance will not fit, checking
is skipped, the original shape remains visible, and retained history stays unverified.
The report says `History check skipped: needs about N GB, M GB free`. Unknown metadata or
memory measurements allow checking. These figures are estimates, not reservations;
simultaneous work can change what is free.

Automatic workers remain capped at two, with lower limits for detailed parts and retained
preparations. Explicit requests stay bounded by part counts and free-memory worker budgets.
Small imported parts can still use serial preparation.

Component extraction shares one geometry index per design, across workers and serial
retries. Geometry stays in compact JSON until a component reaches it; each component
copies only its selected rows. Name collection also streams the design, and Fusion skips
visibility expansion when there are no consumed or removed bodies. The decoded design
and extracted parts still remain in memory for mapping. Placement admission copies each model's own data without first cloning
its entire child tree. Sketch ownership reads only its feature and definition records;
reference sketches expand the neutral model once, without native payloads or a second
geometry copy. Checking adds its own allowance as described above.

`--no-verify` keeps checking off. `--no-memory-check` forces requested checking even if
memory is low. Desktop Advanced offers the same override as **Convert and check history
even if memory is low**. CLI, desktop, web conversions and MCP use the same policy.
