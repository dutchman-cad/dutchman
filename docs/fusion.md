# Fusion: what converts today, and what stands in the way

Dutchman reads Fusion archives (`.f3d`) through cadmpeg's Fusion codec,
cadmpeg's most complete native reader. This page says what Dutchman makes of what that codec
gives and which upstream gaps remain. Improvements land in cadmpeg and reach Dutchman when the
pin is bumped.

## Parts and history

Bodies a Combine used up as a tool, or that a Remove step took out of the design, are left out when cadmpeg marks them hidden and no component owns them; an Info `bodies` note gives the count. Bodies you hid yourself stay available, and a part with both shown and hidden bodies is shown whole, with an Info note.

| What the codec gives | What Dutchman does |
|---|---|
| The design's B-rep, with body transforms applied. | Converts it: restated as STEP, written as SolidCraft's import. |
| A design saved while Fusion was offline, which records no cloud lineage. | Reads it like any other design. |
| A Base Feature that holds a stored solid (no recipe), typed as a base body. | Writes it as a SolidCraft Import at its place in the timeline; later features keep their history. A Base Feature proven to hold no bodies is not needed. |
| Stored geometry from any format (`stored_geometry`) with output bodies, solids and sheets. | The same Import, holding exactly the bodies it outputs. |
| A mesh body whose container cadmpeg cannot decode. | Leaves it out and reports it as an undecoded mesh body. |
| Parameters, planar sketches with typed and native constraints. | Mapped; native constraints are reported as not carried. |
| Spatial (3D) sketches. | Mapped as SolidCraft 3D sketches at their solved positions (lines, arcs, circles, splines, points); constraints and links to model edges are reported as not carried, and a later sweep path or rail picked from their curves follows them. |
| Typed extrudes, revolves, fillets, chamfers and more, with selections often native. | Extrudes, revolves, lofts, sweeps, spheres, tori and coils map (see ARCHITECTURE.md for the cases); boxes and cylinder primitives wait on cadmpeg placing them; simple, counterbore and countersink holes drilled at a sketch's points map; constant-radius fillets and equal-setback chamfers map from proven feature input edge geometry, matched on SolidCraft's own replay of the history before them (a fillet with a tangency weight of exactly 1 maps as a circular fillet, with an Info note; any other weight is refused); other blends and holes placed on unresolved faces wait on input geometry (see guide.md). |

Fusion stores consumed Combine tools (with keep-tools off) and bodies removed by the
timeline alongside its live bodies. For `.f3d`, designs inside `.f3z`, and component parts,
Dutchman leaves out bodies cadmpeg marks hidden only when no CADIR product definition lists
them in its `bodies`. Their exclusive geometry is left out too, with one Info note giving
the count and reason. History remains available; a reference that can no longer map is
reported as a history blocker.

User-hidden bodies that still belong to a component are kept, with an Info note. Hidden
occurrences remain hidden; the current writer shows a part with both shown and hidden bodies
whole, so its hidden members can appear visible in SolidCraft.

When every active feature using a sketch selects explicit whole-loop regions, unused lines
crossing selected whole circles are kept as construction geometry. This preserves
layout lines through hole centres without splitting the circular holes during replay. If
another active consumer needs the whole sketch or a different selection form, those lines
stay solid.

Resolved `to_plane` extrude ends map before any body-building feature when the terminating
plane is parallel to the sketch. The plane origin becomes a fixed SolidCraft To Object point;
a construction plane or body face need not exist there. After earlier geometry, `to_plane`
ends are not supported yet: SolidCraft can reinterpret a point on an existing face as a
different end, and CADIR supplies no input face geometry to prove which face exists then.
Final-body faces cannot establish that timeline state. Tilted plane ends and native,
generated, or historical vertex selections are not supported yet. Symmetric To Object ends
and non-blind ends against the sketch normal on two-sided extrudes remain unsupported.

An extrude whose profile is a face of the model as it was earlier in the timeline
(`historical_faces`, "extrude this face") is rebuilt from that face's boundary. CADIR carries
no surface for such a face, but it keeps the ends, midpoint and tangent of every edge around a
selected face in the feature's own input topology. Dutchman reads those edges as straight lines,
circular arcs and full circles in one plane, chains them into closed loops (a loop inside a loop
is a hole) and writes a sketch of them on that plane, ahead of the extrude, taking every
profile. The extrude runs along the face's outward normal, which only the body knows: after
SolidCraft has replayed the history before the extrude, Dutchman finds the face among the
rebuilt faces (same plane, same area, every boundary edge on it and named for it) and mirrors the
sketch if it was written on the inner side. A face it cannot find exactly once, an edge that is
not a line or circular arc, a boundary that does not close or is not flat, an input topology
without edge geometry for the face, a direction of its own, and ends to or from an object
leave the extrude unmapped with the reason. Faces that share an edge are refused. Without a
SolidCraft CLI to replay the history, the extrude waits for one like a blend does.

## Appearances

Body and face appearance bindings follow the component definition's own BREP ids into its
written geometry, including imported and stored solids. Every placement inherits that
geometry's looks. A body binding supplies the body colour, and face bindings override it per face.
When a body has no body binding and all its faces have the same resolved appearance,
Dutchman writes one body colour, which SolidCraft shows in its body appearance controls.
Mixed appearances remain face looks, selected by points in the component's coordinates.
Imported body names are made unique across the design so an unpainted namesake in another
component cannot receive a painted body's appearance.
The look keeps the resolved colour, opacity, and appearance name; it does not infer a
physical material from a visual preset.

A binding whose target or appearance cannot be resolved is reported as Dropped under
`appearance`. Mixed curved faces without a resolved planar interior point cannot receive
SolidCraft's point-selected face looks yet; their bindings are also reported as Dropped.
Uniformly painted curved bodies can still use a body colour. Conflicting assignments to
one target are left out and reported. Textures and shader properties are not mapped by this
look mapping.

The pinned cadmpeg CADIR supports body and face appearance targets, but has no component or
occurrence appearance target kind. Those assignments need a cadmpeg IR extension before
Dutchman can receive them. A source appearance absent from CADIR cannot be reconstructed;
remaining grey bodies may therefore still need additional decoding in cadmpeg.

## Components

Assemblies with multiple top-level designs group each design's features into a uniquely
named timeline folder, including the root design's own features when present, while keeping
feature order and leaving joints outside folders; a single part or one top-level design
gets no folders.
Features of one design separated by another design's features use numbered folders to
preserve timeline order.

A Fusion design can define components and place them, several times over (a copy and paste
of a component places it twice). cadmpeg gives each placement as a local occurrence with its
transform, and each component as a product definition.

- **When a component lists its bodies,** Dutchman writes the design as SolidCraft components:
  one per component, holding only that component's bodies as an import, one occurrence per
  placement, and the design's own loose bodies as one more component at the origin. This works
  for any format whose CADIR says which bodies a component owns.
- **Each component keeps its own history:** all features and parameters cadmpeg identifies as
  belonging to its definition, including features with no output-body links, plus the features
  that make its bodies and the sketches it owns with their building features. Referenced
  features come along, but timeline predecessors alone do not. A feature explicitly owned by
  another component stays out; without ownership, the existing body and sketch links still
  select history. Root-owned history goes to the design's loose-body component when it exists.
  The component's history is then mapped and checked like a single part's; when it does not
  map, the component keeps its bodies as an import and the report names its first blocker.
- **When it does not,** the design converts as stored and the report says so (Degraded,
  `components`): the geometry is written once, so a placement whose geometry the file does
  not store separately is not shown.
- **Mirrored placements** use a shared component named `<component> (mirrored)` with
  reflected geometry and outward-facing solids. Ordinary copies retain the original
  component and its history. Nested reflections compose, including pairs that cancel.
  Mirrored definitions keep imported geometry only; the report notes any history left out.
  Joints touching a mirrored component are left out with a note and the placed pose retained.
  Tiny numeric drift in placements is corrected. Non-finite, scaled, or sheared placements
  beyond tolerance are left out with a Dropped note naming the occurrence index and kind.
- **Components inside components** become sub-assemblies: a component that holds others
  becomes a SolidCraft component with them beneath it, placed by occurrences inside it, and its
  own bodies as one more component at its origin. cadmpeg places the components a design's root
  component contains inside one occurrence of that root component, so such a design converts
  as the root component with its components beneath it. A component placed several times must
  hold the same components in the same places each time; when it does not, or when a placement
  is inside an occurrence the design does not place, the design converts as stored and the
  report says why.
- **Hidden components and bodies** stay hidden: a placement whose occurrence the design hides,
  or whose part holds only bodies the design hides (a design's own body hidden beside its
  components, say), is written as a SolidCraft occurrence hidden in every placement of what
  holds it. Its geometry is still converted and can be shown again in SolidCraft. A part with
  shown and hidden bodies is shown whole.
- **Joints** between components become SolidCraft joints: fixed ones rigid (their offset kept),
  revolute ones turning about the connector's z axis with their limits, slider ones along it.
  Each connector frame is in its own part, as cadmpeg gives it, which is how SolidCraft takes
  it. The two frames meet face to face, as the faces they were snapped to do: same origin,
  opposite z axes, the second half a turn about the first's x axis. Fusion can store a joined
  part where it was before its joints were solved, so Dutchman places joined parts where their
  joints put them: from the design's own root, each joint places the part at its other end; a
  joint neither of whose parts is placed yet moves its first part to its second, as Fusion moves
  the first part picked for a joint. A joint to a part inside an identity-placed component
  places the outermost such component below the common ancestor, carrying its internal
  joints with it. Internal joints solve first, so the outer joint uses the inner part's
  solved connector position. A file pose, grounding joint, or earlier joint holds that component in
  place instead; a conflicting outer joint is suppressed. Joints that reach nothing placed
  start from the outermost occurrence they join, which stays where the file puts it. Of a joint
  between a component and a
  part inside it, as a rigid group holds its members to its first, the inner part moves and the
  component keeps its own placement; a component holding a part already placed by an outer
  joint is never moved to meet that part, as that would move the part too. A component a joint
  moves leaves the parts inside it that outer joints placed already where they are. Internal
  joints alone do not fix their holder in the assembly. A component the file stores at the pose it shows
  it in starts placed: its joints are checked there instead of moving it back to where it was
  inserted. This also preserves a child component named by a contained pose inside an inserted
  design when that design has no current pose of its own. An inserted design's own current
  pose holds the design; its children still use their own poses or joints. A contained pose is
  matched within that design instance and its stored owner chain, so an
  unrelated component or mirrored sibling does not inherit the pose. A part two joints would
  place differently is reported, and the joint that cannot hold it is written suppressed:
  SolidCraft solves the joints when it opens a design, and the part stays where the file places
  it. A joint to the design's root component holds its occurrence to the design. Fusion joint motion converts from Dutchman 0.1.5 on (before it, every Fusion joint was
  fixed). A revolute limit on one side only is left out, and the report says so. A component
  placed more than once is held once in the SolidCraft design, so a joint between two parts
  inside one copy of it is that component's own: it is written once, through the first copy, as
  SolidCraft solves joints between repeated parts in the first placement's frame, and every copy
  follows; so is a joint between a copy and a part inside that copy. A joint from a part inside
  one copy to something outside that copy cannot hold the part alone, so it holds the whole copy
  where the part is, and the report says so; when another joint already holds that copy itself
  to the same occurrence, as a rigid group holding both does, the part's joint is left out
  instead. A part inside a design inserted into a component, which Fusion names by its key
  alone, is found inside that component. A component empty in its source becomes an empty
  SolidCraft component, so the joints to it are kept. A joint is left out, and reported as
  Dropped (`joints`), when it is of another kind, joins a component to itself or to one in
  another design, or grounds a part inside a component placed more than once (grounding it would
  ground every copy).

### Upstream gaps

1. **Component bodies.** cadmpeg says which bodies a component owns when the file binds the
   component to its entities (its naming space): the bodies whose body-map entries lie in the
   component's entity range. A component placed by an operation the file does not bind (as in
   some copy-and-paste designs) has no bodies, so that design converts as stored.
2. **Joint motion.** cadmpeg reads revolute and slider joints, and revolute limits; other
   motion types, slider limits and one-sided limits stay fixed with its
   `assembly.joint-motion-undecoded` loss, which the report carries.
3. **Joints between referenced designs.** In an `.f3z`, a joint names each part by its design's
   Fusion document id and occurrence id, which cadmpeg does not yet tie to the occurrences it
   merges, and the merged occurrences do not say which bodies they hold; such a design converts
   as stored.

`.f3z` multi-document archives (a design with the designs it references) convert like `.f3d`:
cadmpeg merges the referenced designs into the root design with their placements, as
components.

While reading an `.f3z`, Dutchman shows the current stage and elapsed time with a five-second
still-working heartbeat. cadmpeg owns member discovery and composition; decode attempts
can repeat, so the progress display does not infer unique design counts or a determinate
reading bar for `.f3z`.
A single `.f3d` reports one design when its read succeeds.

Optional [diagnostic logs](troubleshooting.md#diagnostic-logs-for-unfinished-runs) record salted `.f3z`
member ids, sizes, actual decode starts/finishes/failures, and re-decode counts. Per-member
records appear when the decoder reports them; they do not establish a unique design total
for the progress bar. The pinned decoder's observer is installed on the decoding thread.
