# Machine-readable reports

Onshape bundles add the format identifier `onshape_bundle` and extension
`onshape-bundle` to the existing format fields and listings. Existing report
schemas and fields are unchanged. Reader losses use
`onshape/history.not-supported` for a feature that stops history and
`onshape/sketch.constraint-not-supported` for a dropped relation whose solved
curves remain. Both are Degraded losses at stage `map`. The existing `history`
rows and `verification` describe CADIR mapping and comparison with the bundle's
STEP export; see [Onshape](onshape.md).
The optional bundle manifest field `consistent` is input metadata, not a new
report field. `false` produces an ordinary decode failure explaining how to fetch
a consistent snapshot; older v1 bundles lacking the field remain accepted.

## Saved desktop and watch reports

The desktop app saves each converted file's full `dutchman.convert/1` report as
`<stem>.report.json` beside its design. Failed files save `<stem>.failed.json` in the
output folder. Watch mode uses the same names and schema. These are the same per-file
reports as CLI `convert --json`, including local paths, names and detailed losses; keep
them local. They are not anonymous reports.

MCP `read_report` reads a saved report without opening or decoding its source or design.
It preserves every saved field and adds optional `loss_groups` to `dutchman.convert/1`:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `loss_groups` | Array grouped by the pair `(code, stage)`, ordered by code then stage, with missing values first. |
| `loss_groups[].code`, `.stage` | Original loss code and stage, or `null` when not recorded. |
| `loss_groups[].count` | Number of original losses in this group. |
| `loss_groups[].losses` | Full original loss entries, in their saved order within this group. |

The original `losses`, `history` (including features and parts), `completeness`, and
`verification` fields retain their saved values. No result is recomputed or inferred.
This local tool returns names and paths; anonymous diagnostic tools keep their anonymous
schemas. See [MCP privacy and usage](mcp.md#read-an-existing-result).

The Windows per-user installer includes `dutchman` and `dutchman-mcp` on the user PATH.
Their JSON schemas are the same as those from the portable ZIP; installer updates and logs
are described in [the desktop guide](desktop.md#updates). Release packages include this
Markdown schema guide and an `AGENTS.md` explaining how to read saved `<stem>.report.json`
files, including `ok`, `losses`, `history`, and `verification`.

## Project inputs

Files whose names start with `~$` are lock files. They are ignored in project planning
and excluded from job, failure and skipped-file counts.

ZIP directory data and ZIP64 extensible records are limited to 16 MiB each before
the ZIP directory is allocated; entry budgets count every declared entry.

The `dutchman.convert-all/1` report adds `plan`, a sentence describing assembly, part and
STEP counts and the strategy of converting assemblies with their parts. Project ZIPs use the
same schema as folder inputs. Counts describe the project inventory before referenced parts are grouped into assemblies.
Those parts do not get separate results. Paired STEP exports are included in the STEP
count and identified as fallbacks.

When native conversion fails and a same-name adjacent STEP export is tried, its
`dutchman.convert/1` result adds `native_failure`, containing the full original native
conversion report. The result's `input` describes the STEP export and its `output` uses
the native job's planned destination. A successful native conversion never converts the
paired STEP export separately. A `project/step-fallback` loss explains the fallback
in desktop, web and text reports. Neither field changes the meaning of existing fields.

The `dutchman` command also dispatches installed Dutchman CAD tools such as `pilot` and
`fixtures` through `dutchman-<tool>` beside the command or on `PATH`. `dutchman --help`
lists them. These external commands provide their own interfaces; the conversion MCP tools
and JSON reports described here retain their existing schemas.

The full CLI also accepts `dutchman part.f3d` (or `dutchman convert part.f3d`) and derives
the output beside the input from `--to`. An existing derived output is kept with exit 2;
choose `-o PATH` or use `--force` to replace it. `--force` conflicts with `--no-clobber`.
Explicit outputs retain their replacement behaviour. MCP output paths remain required except for `convert` with `dry_run: true`.

`dutchman convert --json` and `dutchman inspect --json` print one JSON object on stdout. During reading and conversion, progress JSON lines are written to
stderr unless `--quiet` is set. The `dutchman-mcp` server's tools return the same objects, as structured
content and as text, with `isError` set when `ok` is false. The schema is named in `schema`. Within a schema version, fields are only
added: none is renamed, retyped or removed. A change that would break a reader gets a new
version (`dutchman.convert/2`).

Sketch losses describe unresolved distance operands and ambiguous curve-only coincidences
specifically, including dimension values that match neither the line nor its finite endpoint. Cosmetic thread blockers distinguish missing diameter/pitch from historical
faces without input surface geometry. Unspecified modeled construction, when an annotation
can be placed, adds a Degraded loss explaining that only the cosmetic annotation is kept.
These use the existing loss fields; no report schema or field changes.

When bodies belonging only to inactive configurations are left out, `losses` includes an
Info entry with code `dutchman/configuration.inactive-bodies-left-out`, subject
`configurations`, and stage `map`. Its message counts the bodies left out and names the
saved configuration. Bodies with unknown membership are kept. No schema fields change.

## `dutchman.progress/1`

`convert --json`, `convert-all --json`, `inspect --json`, and `watch --json` write progress
as one JSON object per line on stderr.
Stdout remains the existing final report (or watch-event stream), with no progress objects
embedded or appended.
`--quiet` suppresses progress. Stage changes, running-step changes and design completions emit events immediately;
a running read or conversion also emits a heartbeat every five seconds. Events are ordered per file;
files in a batch may interleave. No completion event is promised after a process is stopped.

```json
{"schema":"dutchman.progress/1","input":{"path":"part.f3d","format":"fusion_archive"},"stage":"decode","elapsed_ms":5000,"designs_read":0,"designs_total":1,"heartbeat":true}
```

`input` uses the same input object as the final report. `stage` is the current stage id:
`input`, `decode`, `project`, `map`, `write`, or `solidcraft`. The current conversion pipeline
includes output building and verification in `map`; inspection planning also uses `map`.
`elapsed_ms` is an integer duration since this file's conversion began. `designs_read` counts
successfully read unique documents, including assembly documents, rather than placements or
entities. `designs_total` is an integer when known, otherwise `null`. `heartbeat` is true for
timer updates and false for stage or count changes. A geometry-only retry does not count the
same document twice. Counts describe reading only, not the percentage of total conversion time.

`running` is an additive, nullable object. Older workers may omit it; consumers should
fall back to `stage`. It describes the longest-running current step across part workers.
A nested check replaces preparation on that worker until it finishes. Its fields are:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `opening`, `reading`, `projecting` (checking the decoded model), `preparing`, `checking` (target application), `checking_original`, `checking_history`, `checking_blends`, `checking_prefix`, `checking_geometry`, or `writing`. Independent of the coarse `stage`. |
| `name` | Local part, design or output name, or `null` for a whole stage. Display names are bounded to 240 characters, with control characters replaced by spaces. Treat as private text, like `input.path`. |
| `elapsed_ms` | Unsigned milliseconds since this step began; resets when the running step changes. |
| `usual_ms` | Existing estimate for a whole stage when available, otherwise the documented threshold for this unit of work; a longer duration displays “Still …”. |
| `limit_ms` | Unsigned milliseconds for this step's enforced limit, or `null` when none applies. A whole-file timeout is separate. |
| `consequence` | Plain local explanation of what happens past the limit, or `null` when none applies. |

For example, `"running":{"kind":"checking","name":"Bracket","elapsed_ms":12000,
"usual_ms":60000,"limit_ms":120000,"consequence":"the check stopped, and the history is kept unverified"}`.
Local text progress and desktop cards format the same fields using a single duration
(`45 s`, `1 min 1 s`, `2 min`, `1 h 5 min`, or `1 h`); numeric milliseconds are unchanged.
Names and consequence text are excluded from anonymous reports and diagnostic logs. Passing a limit emits a final step
snapshot before the guard ends, even when it happens between five-second heartbeats.
See [progress during conversion](command-line.md#progress-during-conversion) for thresholds
and the outcomes of each limit. None of these fields changes the final conversion report.

The current cadmpeg API owns the Fusion `.f3z` member loop: its counts remain zero and `null`
respectively, even when the archive finishes reading. Separate assembly files report their
completed documents with an unknown total. A heartbeat says the worker is running, without
claiming that the decoder completed more work. Final report schemas remain unchanged.
MCP and the web app return their final reports without a progress stream.

## Exit codes

A geometry-only retry removes history, sketches, parameters and associated design records
before validation, including parameter links on joints. When it succeeds, `losses` includes
the existing `Degraded` loss with subject `history` and stage `project`, stating that parameters
were left out and giving the original check failure. Geometry and assembly checks still apply;
report schemas and field names are unchanged.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | The design was converted (`convert`) or read (`inspect`). Losses do not change this. `diagnose --narrow`, `--same-failure` and `--make-report` say what their codes mean in their own schemas below. |
| 1 | It could not be: unsupported or unreadable input, no geometry, an output that could not be written. With `--json`, the report has `"ok": false`. |
| 2 | A usage error (unknown option, missing argument), or a memory-budget refusal. Usage errors print clap text on stderr. Memory refusals with `--json` return a failure report with `estimate` and `choices`. |

## MCP conversion pre-read

`convert` with `dry_run: true` returns `ok: true`, `estimate`, `choices` (as below),
and `fits`, without decoding or writing. `output` is optional. `fits` is a boolean
when both the estimate and available memory are known, otherwise `null`. A dry run
returns `fits: false` for an over-budget estimate instead of attempting conversion.
Standard's pre-read budgets any input without history when only its history-free
estimate fits. The decision is fixed before decoding. The dry run does
not promise that decoding or conversion will succeed. `no_memory_check` permits a run
without changing the physical-memory comparison in `fits`.

Memory refusals from `convert` or `convert_all` carry the matching schema, `ok: false`,
the offending `input`, `error`, `estimate`, and `choices`. A batch refuses before writing
its designs when a pre-read exceeds the budget; it also includes that file's refusal in
`results` with `converted: 0` and `failed: 1`.

## `dutchman.convert/1`

Repeated stderr notes of the same kind are grouped with a count. `--verbose`, `--log`,
and JSON retain each individual loss. Fusion’s material warning can also appear for a
default material: the decoded model does not establish that no source appearance was lost.

```json
{
  "schema": "dutchman.convert/1",
  "ok": true,

  ]
}
```

The current phase fits use six public Fusion assemblies and five small Fusion, Inventor
and SolidWorks parts, measured on Linux with four requested workers and SolidCraft 0.30.1.
Total-peak RAM bands are ±45% for `.f3d` and ±30% for `.f3z`; Inventor/SolidWorks larger-part
growth remains a ±100% heuristic, and FreeCAD keeps ±50%. Component costs and their worst
misses are documented in [Choosing what to keep](presets.md). These are empirical total-peak
envelopes, not guarantees for unseen designs or individual phases.

Time fits include the requested checking cost, including default geometry checking with
history off. `seconds_exact` adds fractional phase times and `seconds` is its ceiling.
`time_band` stays null: other platforms, worker counts and timeout settings have no fresh
timing calibration. The old multipart speedup fraction is not reused after the shared-index
performance change. Worker scheduling itself is unchanged. `band` remains the shared
compatibility field; use `memory_band` and nullable `time_band` for separate coverage.

`threads.used` is the largest bounded Dutchman part-worker limit selected across conversion
stages and embedded members. It excludes threads inside SolidCraft child processes and does
not measure simultaneously busy CPU cores. Failed worker tasks can retry serially.

Default SolidCraft paths use `.sc`; targets before 0.25.1 use `.solidcraft`.
Explicit output paths keep their given extension. The container format stays `solidcraft/23`.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ok` | `true` when the design was written. |
| `estimate` | Quick pre-read estimate, including on memory refusals: `peak_bytes` and `seconds` are unsigned integers; `seconds_exact` is an additive fractional-second elapsed estimate (`seconds` is its ceiling); time bands apply to `seconds_exact`; `band` is the legacy shared heuristic (`0.5` means ±50%); `memory_band` is the separate relative RAM band and `time_band` is a relative time band or `null` when uncalibrated. `band` remains the shared compatibility field; current phase models use their total-memory envelope there, while older combined models retain their heuristic. `null` when unavailable. No design is decoded; a Fusion archive's designs are read one at a time for their own directories. Calibrated on measured conversions (see [Choosing what to keep](presets.md)). Measured formats add independent read, conversion and checking costs; other formats keep their combined heuristic. |
| `threads` | `{requested, used}` records the per-part worker limit (`0`: automatic, `1`: serial) and the bounded maximum used across component slicing and SolidCraft preparation. Counts are limited by part count and available memory, and never below `1`. Present on SolidCraft writes and on assembly reads that reach component slicing, including inspection and other output formats; omitted for pre-read estimates and reads/writers with no part-worker stage. Batch entries and watch reports carry it within each conversion report. Native decoding stays serial. |
| `solidcraft` | SolidCraft output only: `target` is the selected `x.y` minor; `found` is the discovered CLI release as `x.y.z`, or null when unavailable or not checked. `known_newest` is the newest known minor (`0.41`). `status` is `newer`, `too_old`, `older_loses_history`, `current`, or `none_found`. The history status requires an older installed release and a selected target whose writer gates retain less history than newest; `current` includes older releases with no gated history loss. Included even with verification off. When `found` is null, `search` says why: `outcome` (`not_found`, or `found_no_answer` when a CLI was found but did not report its version in time) and `places`, each `{"place", "outcome"}` for `SOLIDCRAFT_CLI`, `PATH`, `beside Dutchman` and the platform's install folders (`Program Files`, `Program Files (x86)`, `per-user install folder`, `Windows registry`, `Applications`, `user Applications`), with `outcome` `unset`, `set_but_missing`, `not_found`, `found` or `used`. This local report adds each `path` and the `cli` chosen; the [anonymous report](report-anon.md) does not. An explicit target wins; otherwise the supported found version capped at known newest, else built-in newest (0.41), is targeted. |
| `choices` | `part_positions` is `smart` (default), `last-shown`, or `first-placed`. Smart admits current poses after checking touching joints, assembly bounds, and repeated inserted designs; last-shown uses available current poses; first-placed ignores later moves. Compatibility `stored_placements` is true only for first-placed. Selected `preset` (`fast`, `standard`, or `full`) and effective `history`, `sketches`, and `joints` booleans after narrowing. `history` is false when Standard leaves history out to fit memory. These describe requested retention, not proof that every feature maps. FreeCAD output honours history only. |
| `part_positions` | Per-conversion placement summary: `mode`, `total`, and disjoint rule counts `displayed`, `current`, `first_placed` whose sum equals `total`. `displayed` counts saved-scene poses, directly bound or derived from agreeing displayed children, which take precedence without the current-pose guards. `bound_displayed` and `derived_holders` partition `displayed`. Only bound rows are used; an absent arena supplies none. `derived_holders` counts world poses inferred bottom-up from displayed children whose estimates agree within 0.001 mm and 1e-6 rotation entries; `holder_conflicts` counts disagreements; the holder keeps its first placement. In Smart a displayed holder whose subtree would leave the grown bounds is counted under `bounds` and reverts with everything inside it, so `derived_holders` counts only holders still displayed. `fallbacks` counts `no_current_pose`, `ambiguous`, `unsupported`, `joints`, `bounds`, and `instances`. Fallback reasons can overlap for ambiguous carriers and are not a partition. Counts describe source occurrences including holders, excluding extra history representations. Smart keeps first placements for unsupported checks; bounds use conservative geometry envelopes. The matching Info note has subject `part positions`. `assumed` lists each part (not holders) whose position nothing confirms, as `{"part", "reason"}`, with `part` naming what holds it, outermost first: `identity` (the placement could not be read and the part sits at its design's origin; a Degraded loss names these), `later_pose_unused` (the file holds a later pose that was not used), or `only_stored_pose` (the stored pose is all the file holds and no joint holds the part). The last two are usually right, so an Info note names the first 20. With `first-placed`, only `identity` is listed, since that mode ignores later poses by choice. The anonymous report leaves part names out. A non-assembly read has zero counts; decode refusals may have no summary. |
| `input.format` | `fusion_archive`, `fusion_multi_document`, `inventor_part`, `inventor_assembly`, `solidworks_part`, `solidworks_assembly`, `freecad_document`, `catia_part`, `creo_part`, `nx_part`, `creo_view`, `rhino`, `acis`, `step`, `iges`, `unclassified_part`, or `null` for an unknown extension. `format_name` is the same for people. Creo and NX share `.prt` and are distinguished by contents; inconclusive contents give `unclassified_part`. |
| `input.words` | Reader status: `reads geometry`, `opens, no geometry yet`, `recognised, not read yet`, or `open it in SolidCraft directly` (IGES); `null` for an unknown format. Present on successes and failures, including batch results and MCP reports. The conversion's history and verification describe what this file kept. |
| `input.program`, `input.extension` | Program or format family, and the input's actual suffix without a dot, used for status text (`prt.12` for a numbered save). Unknown programs are `null`. |
| `output.format` | The SolidCraft design format written. |
| `mode` | `history`: editable feature history, with the original geometry kept beside it, suppressed. `partial_history`: retained editable features in a hidden component and the visible imported final shape. `import`: geometry, possibly with reference sketches. |
| `retried_after_low_memory` | Present and `true` when a batch file stopped for low memory alongside other files and was converted again alone at the end of the batch. The report is of that second try: if it converted, an Info line under `memory` says so; if not, `error` holds the memory stop. |
| `history_check_skipped` | Present only when a requested SolidCraft history/geometry check was skipped for memory. Object with `needed_bytes` (estimated extra memory), `available_bytes` (free memory at the decision), and `reason`: `History check skipped: needs about N GB, M GB free`. The conversion can still have `ok: true`; retained history stays unverified or partial and the original shape remains usable. Absent when checking is explicitly off, forced, or not skipped. Applies to batch result objects and MCP as well. |
| `verification.status` | `verified`: the history was replayed in SolidCraft, or the FreeCAD output was measured, and matches the original. `differs`: a FreeCAD rebuild differs or restored STEP (`reason` names the part). `unverified`: the history was written without that check (`reason` says why: no `solidcraft-cli`, a timeout, `--no-verify`). `partial`: only partial history is retained; `reason` names the blocker, gives kept/total source feature counts, and states whether retained features replayed or remain unverified. This never claims the full history matches the original. `flattened`: no body-building prefix was retained (`reason`: the blocker or replay failure). `not_applicable`: there was no history to write (none in the source, or none cadmpeg decodes: every feature is kept in its native form), or `--import-only`. |
| `history.features` | Every source feature in timeline order. `status`: `mapped`, `not_needed` (the target needs no feature, e.g. a principal datum plane or an unused construction helper), `left_out` (suppressed in the source, changes no geometry in the source, or a reference sketch omitted by choice), `blocked` (does not map; `reason` says why). Each feature also has `ordinal` (its position number in the design's timeline, as the source model numbers it; null when it has none) and `variant` (a short form such as `extrude, to a plane`, or null for kinds without one). `profile_unverified: true` appears on a `mapped` extrude whose profile region could not be checked by the source end-cap area proof: it is kept, but that proof did not establish the region it swept. An extrude whose profile region does not match the source is `blocked` with a `reason` of `its profile region doesn't match the source (swept A mm², the source B mm²)` and a loss with code `history/profile-region-mismatch`. |
| `history.rebuilt`, `history.needing` | Features that became SolidCraft features, out of those that need one: all but left-out and not-needed ones. These are the counts to quote. |
| `history.reapplied` | Kept features that re-apply to a base body Fusion stores only as the design ends (a join, cut or intersection after it), so editing them may not change the shape. They are mapped, but not counted in `history.rebuilt`. |
| `history.features[].reapplied`, `final_body` | `true` on such a kept feature, and on the base feature written with its final body. Absent otherwise. |
| `history.mapped`, `history.total` | Mapped or not-needed features, out of all but left-out ones. `mapped` counts features that needed nothing, such as component inserts and joints, so it isn't a count of editable features. |
| `history.features[].source`, `category`, `upstream`, `reason_raw` | Present only on a feature SolidCraft itself refused when it replayed the history. `source` is `solidcraft`; `reason` then reads `SolidCraft refused feature "X": ...` without SolidCraft's internal site number, and `reason_raw` keeps the original text. `category` is `solidcraft-refused` for a refusal not yet recognised, or a specific name such as `fillet-overflows-neighbouring-face` (the blend is larger than the neighbouring faces). `upstream` is the link to the SolidCraft issue that tracks a known category, else `null`. Absent for Dutchman's own mapping limits. |
| `history.parts` | For an assembly written as SolidCraft components: each part's history, in the order written. `name`; `status` and `reason` as in `verification` (`not_applicable` when the part has no source features, else `flattened` with its first blocker, `partial`, `unverified` or `verified`); `mapped`, `total`, `rebuilt`, `needing` and `reapplied` as in `history`. A part placed several times is listed once. Absent for a single part. |
| `completeness` | For an assembly: `placed` counts placements with geometry and assembly holders of children; `placed_empty` counts placements of leaf parts with no bodies. Empty leaves no longer inflate `placed`. `placements` is `placed + placed_empty + sum(left_out.count)`. Counts include every recorded placement through placed sub-assemblies, each as often as placed. `left_out` lists those not placed by cause, most first: `file` (the file placed, or `null`), `reason`, `stage` and `count`. Absent for a single part. |
| `joints` | For an assembly whose joints were written: how many of each kind, `{"revolute": 5, "rigid": 1}` (kinds `revolute`, `slider`, `rigid`). Grounded joints count as `rigid`, fixing their occurrence to the design at its stored placement. Absent when none were. |
| `names` | Every name the conversion met, sorted: the paths and folders it read from, and the names the design gives its parts, components, bodies, features, sketches, parameters and properties. For tools that take names out of a report before it is shared (the anonymous report does); absent when there were none. |
| `losses` | What did not survive intact. `level` is `Info` (no effect on geometry), `Degraded` (carried in a weaker form) or `Dropped` (left out). `code` is a stable cadmpeg or Dutchman loss code when available, else `null`; `subject` says what was affected; `message` is for people. `stage` and `upstream` say where it arose (below). |

An empty leaf retains its component and joints and adds a `Degraded` loss whose
`subject` is `part N`, using the anonymous catalog number from `diagnose` and `--part`.
Assembly holders are not empty leaves. A STEP finding with code
`step/topology.region-solid-reduced-to-sheet` also adds a `Degraded` geometry loss
at stage `write` with the count of affected solid regions. Intended sheets do not
receive that loss.

The conversion `estimate.peak_bytes` includes the requested SolidCraft check unless
`--no-verify` / MCP `verify: false` is selected. Geometry-only work still checks the
converted shape, with its own calibrated extra cost. Conversion-only preflight can allow a run
whose check will not fit; `history_check_skipped` records the actual post-read decision.
The check allowance uses the same metadata-based extra check estimate as the desktop,
compared with current free memory after reading and again before replay. It does not
multiply the resident design's memory. Automatic part workers use at most two workers and can reduce to
serial work for a large per-part peak or retained preparation queue.

Offset datum planes need no building feature when their support resolves or all their
consumers carry independent resolved sketch placements. Otherwise the history reason
names the unresolved plane reference; resolved skipped planes count as `not_needed`.

A partial history that replays but whose bodies differ from what the source stores at the same
point adds a `Degraded` loss with code `history/body-mismatch`, and `verification.reason` says
so: fewer bodies, or a body the source has with no replayed body whose box centre is near
enough. When the source marks a body's box as the solid's own (Fusion's `body_centers_exact`),
its centre must be within the larger of 0.5 mm and 1% of the replayed body's box diagonal.
Other boxes are taken over edge vertices, interior samples and proven arc extremes; their
centres must be within the larger of 1 mm and 2% of the replayed body's box diagonal.
The source's list can leave bodies out, so more
replayed bodies than it lists don't count. It is compared when the last retained feature that isn't a
sketch carries the source's bodies, which Fusion files can. In a design with components, a list
that features of more than one component carry isn't any one component's state, so it isn't used.
A base feature written with its body as the design ends (`final_body`) isn't compared either: the
source's stored state after it is the body before later features changed it.
A state whose source marks any body centre as based on incomplete edge evidence
(`body_centers_incomplete`) is not compared, even if every body has a centre entry, so the
history stays unverified there.

A feature whose source profile is the whole of a sketch with more than one profile is kept only
when SolidCraft confirms it: the full history matches the original, or, in a partial history, the
replay holds the bodies the source stores at that point. Otherwise the history stops before it,
saying its profile is the whole of a sketch with several profiles.

An unresolved `sketch_selection` may retain a candidate built from selected neutral curve ids or
its carrier sketch only after the same source body comparison confirms it. The loss
`history/profile-region-inferred` has level `Degraded`, names the consuming feature in `subject`,
and says Dutchman inferred the region and the source body check confirmed it. This body check is
separate from an extrude's end-cap area proof, which `profile_unverified` continues to describe. A failed or
unavailable check blocks the feature with `its inferred profile region could not be confirmed by
the source body check`. Trimmed regions select interior points from their directed boundary
intervals; an unclosed or ambiguous boundary blocks with `its trimmed profile boundary does not
close unambiguously or has no unambiguous interior point`. These add no report fields.

Shells require removed faces from their own historical input topology, a resolved
thickness and inward or outward direction, and one earlier named body. A shell input-face
blocker means the source selection or historical boundary is not supported yet; final-body
faces cannot establish which face existed before shelling.

A through-all cut with no earlier named body is `blocked` before replay, with a reason
asking for its body-producing feature to resolve first. Source storage order does not
change replay order: the neutral ordinal controls it.

SolidCraft version presentation uses minors: `solidcraft.target` and
`solidcraft.known_newest` now contain `x.y` strings (for example, `"0.41"`), changing their
previous `x.y.z` representation. `solidcraft.found` keeps the full CLI release (for example,
`"0.41.0"`). Status comparisons use minors, so all 0.41 patches are current; 0.42 is newer
and 0.17 is too old. Patch-sensitive writer gates and the internal 0.18.2 verification
floor remain unchanged. Explicit `solidcraft_version` inputs still accept `x.y.z` for
precise gate control.

`solidcraft.status` compares the installed minor with 0.18 and `known_newest`:
`newer` is above the newest minor, `too_old` is below the floor, and `none_found` has no readable
installed version. Within the supported range, `older_loses_history` requires an older
installed release and a selected target that disables editable writer capabilities;
otherwise it is `current`. Today those capabilities are sketch-profile coils and ordered
mirror-pattern chains, both introduced in 0.25 patch 1. The 0.22 patch 1 entry-recess tip representation
change preserves geometry and does not count as history loss. These fields use local
version discovery only.

SolidCraft history verification compares body count and each body's position, box, area,
and volume. Position and box checks allow the larger of 0.01 mm and 0.02% of the
larger box diagonal, for the centre distance and each minimum/maximum coordinate. Volume and
area retain their measuring mesh tolerances. Bodies are paired by nearest box centre,
with volume breaking ties. A position mismatch gives a reason such as `a body sits 6.000 mm
from the original's position`; a box mismatch gives `a body's box differs from the
original's by 2.500 mm`. When SolidCraft gives no box for a pair, only area and volume are
compared. A face-count difference (SolidCraft can merge faces on one surface) produces
no geometry loss, nor does an open-shell warning when the compared measurements agree.
Geometry-only output has no independent source measurements; evaluation errors, unmeshable faces, solids
without volume, solids opened as open shells, and bodies inside out still produce `Degraded` losses with subject `geometry` and stage `solidcraft`.
Sheets remain exempt from volume and closed-shell checks. The GUI, CLI, web app, and MCP
present these same losses; `verification.status` continues to describe history, and the
schema is unchanged.

IGES (`.igs`, `.iges`) is recognised as `input.format: "iges"` and refused before decoding
in conversion, inspection, batch results and MCP reports. Its `error.message` is
`Dutchman doesn't convert IGES yet: open it in SolidCraft directly (File > Import).`,
with `error.stage: "decode"` and `error.upstream: null`. Batch results count it as a refused
file (`ok: false`); the CLI and GUI do not offer a fixtures invitation for IGES.
The formats listing reports `status: "not_supported"`, `words: "open it in SolidCraft directly"`
and `converts: "SolidCraft imports IGES itself (File > Import)"`.

When SolidCraft has a quarantine attribute without the user-approved flag on macOS,
`verification.reason` explains how to allow its first run in Finder or System Settings
and try again; the history stays `unverified`. A geometry check that cannot run records
the same guidance in its `not checked` loss message.

Stored geometry (`history.features[].kind: "stored_geometry"`) becomes a mapped base-body
Import feature. When the mapped features are only stored geometry, `mode` is `"import"`
and `verification.status` is `"not_applicable"`, with reason “This part holds an imported
solid; there is no feature history to bring over”. The same message appears in `losses`
with level `"Info"`; nothing was dropped. Later mappable features keep the usual history
mode and verification. The desktop app shows the same Info message from this report.
These use existing fields in the schema; `inspect` reports the same stored-only outcome.

FreeCAD external links use the existing assembly fields: missing or unreadable referenced
`.FCStd` files appear in `completeness.left_out` with `file`, `reason`, `stage`, and `count`,
and in `losses`. Available linked Bodies and Parts convert as placed components; link-array
elements count once. Grounded parts appear as rigid joints, and unsupported joints have
loss notes while stored placements are retained. No report schema fields are added.

Constant-radius fillets and equal-setback chamfers whose proven input edges span several
bodies become one SolidCraft blend per body, with numbered names from the same source
feature. The report keeps one `mapped` feature outcome for that source feature.

For FreeCAD fillets and chamfers, `history.features[].reason` reports missing stored input
edge geometry or a failed replay proof. Resolved edges without proven membership in an
earlier stored feature result are refused. This uses the existing feature status and reason
fields; no report fields change.

For a blocked sweep, `history.features[].reason` names the unsupported option, such as
`sweeps with round corner transitions are not mapped yet` or
`sweeps with linear section interpolation are not mapped yet`. Tangent-path extension and
post-sweep simplification also block history. These are messages within the existing schema;
no report fields change.

A mapped `helical_sweep` becomes a sketch-profile coil only for targets 0.25 patch 1 or newer.
For older targets, `history.features[].reason` says
`needs SolidCraft 0.25 patch 1 or newer (target 0.18)` (with the actual target), and the history
line explains the blocker. `--solidcraft-version x.y.z` selects the target on `convert`,
`convert-all`, and `watch`; it must be at least 0.18.2. By default the found verification
CLI's version is used, even with `--no-verify`, else the newest release known at build
time (currently 0.41). The supported rolling 14-day window is currently 0.18.2–0.41;
older targets down to 0.18.2 retain the existing feature simplifications.
When a written coil or flat entry-recess tip uses the newer mapping, the history line
includes the actual target, such as `target SolidCraft 0.25 patch 1`. No new report fields are added. Counterbore and countersink holes use an explicit flat tip
for targets 0.22.1 or newer, retaining the source's flat bottom.

Conical and spiral helices report
`conical and spiral helical sweeps are not supported yet: SolidCraft's sketch-profile coil
has no radial growth or cone angle` in `history.features[].reason`. Dimensions without
feature parameter bindings produce a `Degraded` loss saying their resolved values were
kept. These use existing schema fields.

For holes, a blocked feature's `reason` names the unsupported entry form, placement, or end
(for example, `a hole ending at the last encountered face is not mapped yet`). A tapped hole
maps with an ISO metric thread label; thread details it can't keep are a `Degraded` loss on
that feature. The wording is text for people, not a stable code.
Counterbores, countersinks, and chamfered entries with drill points map for SolidCraft 0.22.1
and newer; for an older target they report
`SolidCraft holes take a drill point only on a plain drilled hole`: SolidCraft 0.21.0 ignores
`tip_angle` on entry recesses. This uses the existing blocked feature and reason fields.

Sheet-metal edge flanges with proven input-edge picks and supported dimensions report
`mapped`. Other flanges report `blocked` with the specific selection or dimension reason
(for example, "its input edge midpoint does not identify exactly one rebuilt edge"). Hems
report the form or developed length SolidCraft cannot express. A blocked history falls back
to geometry. These use the existing report fields; no schema fields change.

Renamed parameter names are included in `names` so anonymous reports can remove them.
Fusion consumed tools and removed bodies are omitted only when cadmpeg marks them hidden
and no component owns them, with an Info `bodies` note giving the count. User-hidden
component members stay available; mixed shown/hidden parts are shown whole, with an Info
note. See [Fusion visibility](fusion.md#parts-and-history).

Parameter expression fallbacks use the existing `losses` records: `subject` is
`parameter <written name>`, `level` is `Degraded` when a scalar value is retained, and
`Dropped` when neither expression nor scalar value can be written. The message names the
unsupported function, conditional, unresolved or ambiguous reference, cycle, or syntax
limitation. Spreadsheet text and empty cells produce no parameter loss; unused numeric
cells produce an `Info` note. These are mapping observations, not additional schema fields.
`verification.status: verified` compares initial geometry and does not certify that every
source expression was decoded or that edits reproduce the source design's dependencies.

SolidWorks assembly reports use `input.format: "solidworks_assembly"` and
`input.words: "reads geometry"`. The existing assembly completeness and loss fields report
external occurrences left out and configuration fallbacks.

A failure carries `"ok": false`, `input` and `error`, and exits 1:

```json
{"schema": "dutchman.convert/1", "ok": false,
 "input": {"path": "part.prt", "format": "creo_part", "format_name": "Creo part (.prt, .prt.N)"},
 "error": {"message": "Creo part (.prt, .prt.N): reading geometry is not supported yet. …",
           "stage": "decode", "upstream": "cadmpeg"}}
```

When cadmpeg reports mesh-body members for a Fusion design with no decoded B-rep bodies
or placed components, Dutchman says "it has mesh bodies (N), which Dutchman
doesn't convert yet, and no solid bodies could be read" and asks you to convert the meshes to
solids in Fusion, then save a new copy. The count comes from typed mesh selections; an
undecoded mesh container or an unresolved source alone cannot supply a count, so the
existing read error remains.
Designs with both B-rep and mesh bodies still convert their B-rep bodies and report reader
losses for meshes it could not decode.

The mesh-body refusal keeps `error.stage: "decode"` when no geometry was transferred,
or `"project"` when mesh geometry was read but no B-rep bodies can be converted.
`error.upstream` stays `"cadmpeg"`; no report fields or error kinds are added.

`error.message` is for people; do not parse its wording. Unreadable-container errors retain
cadmpeg's cause and add recovery advice and a link to the
**A file didn't convert** issue form. The CLI and MCP return the same message, stage, and upstream.
Normal JSON reports contain file names and paths. For sharing, request `--report-anon FILE`
(MCP `report_anon`) and review that file first; keep logs, journals, keys, and salts private.

The desktop app shows Info messages with subject `history` directly on result cards,
including Standard's explanation when history is left out to fit in free memory.
These are existing `losses` entries; desktop estimates and preset labels add no report fields.
The desktop file row shows a live total, including checking only when
checking is on and a usable CLI was found, and showing Standard's reduced history choice.
Its separate read, conversion and check figures and remembered controls are desktop
presentation; CLI and MCP keep the existing estimate fields without adding a split.
The calibrated stage costs add to `peak_bytes` and `seconds_exact`; `seconds` is the
ceiling of that total. Checking is included for geometry-only conversion too.
The CLI and desktop display small estimates as “under 0.1 GB” and “under a minute”;
JSON `estimate.peak_bytes` and `estimate.seconds` remain numeric and unrounded.

Appearance bindings that cannot reach written component geometry, resolve an appearance, or
select a mixed-colour face are recorded in `losses` with subject `appearance` (possibly
prefixed with a part name) and level `Dropped`. Their messages identify the binding.
Unplaced body and face bindings also identify
the target and distinguish “its target is absent from the decoded model” from “its target
exists in the decoded model but has no placed component geometry”. These use the existing
loss fields and schema. Targets deliberately filtered as consumed or removed Fusion
geometry have a separate message. Face-pick failures distinguish an unnamed written body
from a face without a resolved interior point. A decoded body proven to have no writable
STEP shape says “its body has no geometry the STEP writer can write”. Uniform face
appearances carried as a body colour are preserved and do not produce a loss.

### Stages

Every loss, and every failure's `error`, says where in the conversion it arose, so a report of
it reaches the code that can fix it:

| `stage` | Where | `upstream` |
|---|---|---|
| `input` | The file itself, or how it was asked for: missing, too large, the wrong kind, an assembly's parts not beside it. | `null` |
| `decode` | cadmpeg reading the file's bytes: a record or stream it could not decode. | `cadmpeg` |
| `project` | cadmpeg turning what it read into its neutral model: something read but not carried into it (unresolved, unprojected, kept native). | `cadmpeg` |
| `map` | Dutchman mapping the neutral model onto SolidCraft's: a feature, sketch, parameter or joint it does not carry. | `null` |
| `write` | Writing the design: Dutchman's writer, and cadmpeg's STEP restatement within it (a loss with a `step/…` code). | `cadmpeg` for a `step/…` loss, else `null` |
| `solidcraft` | SolidCraft opening or checking the written design. | `solidcraft` |

`upstream` names the project whose code it arose in when that is not Dutchman's. Report it on
Dutchman all the same: Dutchman's maintainers take it upstream.

A cadmpeg loss is at `decode` when its code says the bytes could not be read (`…-undecoded`,
`…-unparsed`, `…-untyped`, framing, a missing or unreadable stream, `…not-transferred`), else
at `project`.

## `dutchman.convert-all/1`

`dutchman convert-all --json --out-dir DIR <files and folders>…` converts every file named, and
every file Dutchman knows in the folders named (with their subfolders; symbolic links are not
followed), several at a time (`--jobs N`, default: the machine's cores, at most 8). Each
design goes to `DIR`, keeping the folder layout below each folder named. A file that fails
does not stop the others.

```json
{"schema": "dutchman.convert-all/1", "ok": false, "converted": 2, "failed": 1, "skipped": 1,
 "skipped_by_extension": {"txt": 1}, "skipped_revisions": [], "resumed": 0,
 "results": [ {"schema": "dutchman.convert/1", "ok": true, "input": {…}, "output": {…}, "elapsed_ms": 412, …},
              {"schema": "dutchman.convert/1", "ok": false, "input": {…}, "error": {…}, "elapsed_ms": 96} ]}
```

`results` holds one `dutchman.convert/1` report per file (inputs that are neither a file nor a
folder come first), in the order found, each with `elapsed_ms`, the time it took. `skipped`
counts older numbered saves and files in the folders searched that are not in a format Dutchman knows; unknown formats are not
converted and not reported one by one, and `skipped_by_extension` counts them by extension
(lower case; `none`, or `other` for one that is not 1–8 letters and digits). `resumed` counts
the files whose reports came from `--journal` rather than a new conversion. `ok` is `true` only
when every file converted; the exit code is then 0, else 1.

For numbered `.prt.N` saves found in a directory, only the highest numeric revision per
part in that folder is converted. `skipped_revisions` lists each older save as
`{"path": "bracket.prt.3", "newer": "bracket.prt.7"}` (full paths as supplied).
These skips count in `skipped`, separately from `skipped_by_extension`. Explicit file
arguments are converted as named. A numbered save strips exactly one revision suffix
before deriving its base output name (`bracket.sc`); existing outputs are kept.
These report additions retain `dutchman.convert-all/1`; existing fields keep their types.

Each file converts in a process of its own. One that runs past `--timeout` or holds more than
`--max-memory` is stopped and fails alone, its `error.stage` the stage it had reached; so does
one that crashes the converter. `--report-anon FILE` also writes the anonymous report,
[`dutchman.report-anon/1`](report-anon.md).

## `dutchman.formats/1`

`dutchman formats --json` lists the native formats Dutchman knows:

```json
{"schema": "dutchman.formats/1", "ok": true, "formats": [
  {"id": "fusion_archive", "name": "Fusion archive (.f3d)", "extension": "f3d",
   "extensions": ["f3d"], "words": "reads geometry", "level": "L5",
   "status": "converts", "converts": "geometry; feature history (…) when every feature maps; …"}
]}
```

`status` is `converts`, `coming` (in progress) or `not_supported`; `converts` says, for people,
what carries across.
`words` is `reads geometry`, `opens, no geometry yet`, `recognised, not read yet`, or
`open it in SolidCraft directly` (IGES).
`level` is cadmpeg's published headline in its format-support ladder (`L0`–`L9`),
or `null` when none is published. It supplements `words` and does not promise conversion
of a particular file. This additive field retains `dutchman.formats/1`.
`extensions` lists all accepted suffixes without dots (`prt.N` denotes a numbered save);
the existing `extension` remains the preferred suffix.
Dutchman attempts conversion when the format reads geometry and its codec is available in
this build. Creo and NX open without geometry support; SolidWorks assemblies and
unclassified `.prt` files are recognised without readers. Reader status does not promise
that a particular file will convert or that every feature will map.
`--quiet` suppresses only the text volunteer invitation after a conversion run; JSON
reports contain neither that invitation nor status prose outside the report.
The invitation appears once for programs with `ok: false`, `verification.status: "flattened"` or `"partial"`,
or `history.mapped < history.total`, except IGES, and offers test-file recipes and private help
in Discord.

## `dutchman.inspect/1`

The same fields as `convert` except `output` (with `completeness` for an assembly), plus
`geometry`, `conversion`, and for an assembly
`assembly: {"parts": <part files read>, "placements": <parts placed at the top level>}`:

```json
{
  "schema": "dutchman.inspect/1",
  "ok": true,
  "input": {"path": "part.f3d", "format": "fusion_archive", "format_name": "Fusion archive (.f3d)"},
  "geometry": {"bodies": 1, "faces": 6},
  "conversion": {"possible": true, "reason": null},
  "mode": "partial_history",
  "verification": {"status": "partial", "reason": "history stopped at feature \"Shell1\": shell waits on input face geometry (2 of 3 features rebuilt); the rest is the imported final shape; prefix unverified: inspect writes nothing"},
  "history": {"mapped": 2, "total": 3, "rebuilt": 2, "needing": 3, "reapplied": 0, "features": [ … ]},
  "losses": [ … ]
}
```

`conversion.possible` is `false` when converting the file would fail, with `reason` saying
why, for example a design whose only geometry is a sketch: "the model has no solids or surfaces
SolidCraft can import". `geometry` counts what was read, whether or not it can be written.

`inspect` writes nothing and runs no SolidCraft, so a history that would be written reports
`verification.status` `unverified`, or `partial` when mapping identifies a retained prefix
(the reason states that the prefix is unverified). Both reports look at every feature;
`blocked` includes operations after the first blocker, and `verification.reason` names the
first blocker.

Sketches that fail replay are retried without constraints and reported at `Degraded` level;
their mapped feature reason records that loss. If the solved geometry still cannot replay,
the sketch is left out and reported as `blocked`.

Signed horizontal and vertical sketch distances that map to positive magnitudes retain
their constraints and expression dependencies without a constraint-loss message. Report
fields and verification statuses are unchanged.

Sketch B-splines use the existing feature status and reason fields. Periodic curves are
clamped by exact endpoint knot insertion. Clamped uniform curves (including equal-weight
rational curves) stay one spline; other spacing and repeated interior knots become exact
spline chains, up to 200 pieces. Constraints that cannot apply to a chain are reported as
Info with `a constraint on an exact spline chain is not carried`; the solved geometry
remains exact. A periodic curve with unequal weights is blocked with `weighted periodic
splines are not supported yet: SolidCraft control splines have no weights`. No report
fields or schema versions change.

Sketch constraint losses keep the existing report fields and schema. Their `message`
counts source constraints, for example `2 of 2 constraints not carried (angle difference:
solver scalar identities have no sketch entity binding, scalar equality: solver scalar
identities have no sketch entity binding); its geometry is exact`. Repeated reasons are
counted with `×N`. Unsupported constraints are `Degraded` losses at `map`; they do not
change a mapped sketch's feature status. Inactive and disabled relations do not create a
loss. Relations in virtual sketch space are counted separately because SolidCraft has no
separate virtual solver space.

Whole-sketch hole placements exclude construction entities; explicit entity selections
can still use construction points or circle centres.

For mirror-containing composite patterns and repeated full-turn endpoints, an attempted
replay that cannot finish keeps the original geometry and reports why. Turning verification
off, or having no usable CLI, still writes unverified history.

Composite feature patterns containing resolved mirrors can map to several ordered timeline
features while retaining one result per source feature in the history report. Each stage
repeats the previous instance set. Chained stages require a target of SolidCraft 0.25 patch 1
or newer; older targets report `needs SolidCraft 0.25 patch 1 or newer` and keep the original
geometry. Single-stage mirrors and patterns still map on every supported target.
A full-turn circular pattern with a repeated seed endpoint
keeps each distinct location once. Replay differences still flatten the history and report
why; body-seeded composite mirrors and unresolved planes remain unsupported.

Body mirror patterns and join/cut/intersect body combines (optionally keeping the tool
bodies) can keep editable history; their bodies must be named by earlier mapped features.
Shells and drafts are refused, since their faces are known only on the final body, where
the feature has already removed or tilted them; they wait on input face geometry.
Replacing a source shape with its mirror is not supported yet: SolidCraft's mirror keeps
the original. Cosmetic threads lack a resolved standard and pitch in CADIR, so assigning
SolidCraft's ISO metric designation would invent thread data; these stop the editable prefix.

When a design falls back to imported geometry, a single Info loss with subject `sketches`
reports `kept N sketches for reference`, followed by `; M left out` when any sketches were
omitted. Only mapped sketches with resolved planes are retained, hidden after the import;
they do not change the body comparison or the report's `mode` and verification status.
`--import-only` leaves out history while retaining reference sketches when the preset
keeps sketches. Use `--no-sketches` as well, or `--preset fast`, for geometry alone.

Assembly timeline folders are reported as Info losses with subject `timeline folders`,
`code: null`, and message `"Name": N feature(s) grouped`, one per folder added. Assemblies
with multiple top-level designs group each design's features, including the root's own
features when present; joints remain outside folders, and feature order is unchanged.
Parts and assemblies with one top-level design have no folders and no such notes.

### FreeCAD macro output (experimental)

For `convert --to freecad` (MCP `to: "freecad"`), `output.format` is
`"freecad-macro/1"` and `output.path` ends in `.FCMacro`. The schema remains
`dutchman.convert/1`; no fields are removed or renamed. Batch results use the same per-file
report. A macro with at least one rebuilt part has `mode: "history"` and
`verification.status: "unverified"` unless headless verification was requested.
An entirely imported macro has `mode: "import"` and `verification.status:
"not_applicable"`. In a mixed assembly the `history.features` and losses identify the parts
kept as STEP. A partial history keeps prefix features and all mapped sketches as `mapped`,
with reference reasons; later body-building features are `blocked`. A `Degraded` loss says
`rebuilt N of M features; kept as reference`, counting sketches but excluding suppressed
features (`left_out`) and organizational features (`not_needed`). These macros also use
`mode: "history"` and `verification.status: "unverified"` unless headless verification was requested; the visible final result remains
STEP when it differs from the prefix. `import_only` blocks all mapped features and retains
no prefix. Runtime rebuild failures restore embedded geometry and warn inside FreeCAD. Headless
execution also records these failures in the conversion report. Scalar parameter values are retained; their expressions are stored as
inert text and are not evaluated by the macro.

Assembly losses use the existing `subject: "joints"`: `Degraded` names each joint option
or operand that cannot be written, and `Info` records inferred grounding and the need to
run the macro. Supported workbench joints retain frames, limits, and suppression. A failed
runtime solve removes the joints, restores stored placements, and warns in FreeCAD;
it cannot modify this conversion report. Joint reconstruction does not change how
`mode` or `verification.status` describe the part histories. `import_only` omits joints.

The CLI also accepts `--to fcstd`: `output.format` is `"freecad-document/1"` and the
output is a native `.FCStd` document. This runs FreeCAD and always measures the result.
`--to freecad --verify` measures without saving a native document. Both use the existing
`verification` object: `status: "verified"` when every part's solid count, volume and bounds
match its source STEP, or the added status `"differs"`, with a `reason` naming the part
and differing measurement or runtime fallback. Runtime fallback reasons also appear as
`Degraded` losses with subject `FreeCAD rebuild`. Feature statuses continue to describe
mapping; a failed runtime rebuild is identified by verification and losses. Volumes use
SolidCraft's 1e-4 relative tolerance; bounds use the same tolerance relative to the largest
local span (minimum 1 mm). Parts without solids cannot be verified. Macro execution errors
use `"unverified"` and `"not checked: …"`; native execution errors fail the conversion.
The default timeout is 300 seconds, changed with `--freecad-timeout`. Output remains
experimental. These CLI additions do not change MCP's existing `to` choices.

For self-hosted browser conversions, [Dutchman Web](web.md#settings) documents the shared
zip budget, concurrent upload and saved-data limits, private data folder, and allowed browser
origins. Uploads may be refused with 403 (origin check) or 503 (capacity); the CLI and MCP
reports are unchanged.

For `dutchman-web --solidcraft`, converted SolidCraft files also have `output.open`, the
same-origin link to open the design in the configured web app. FreeCAD macros have no `open`
field. The link is built when the report is returned, from the current server settings; see
[Open in SolidCraft](web.md#open-in-solidcraft).

## Watch events: `dutchman.watch-event/1`

`dutchman watch INBOX --out-dir DIR --json` streams newline-delimited JSON, one object
per completed attempt. There is no enclosing array or final batch report. Each object has:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema` | `"dutchman.watch-event/1"` |
| `event` | `"converted"`, `"failed"` or `"skipped"` |
| `path` | Input path relative to the inbox, using platform path separators |
| `elapsed_ms` | Milliseconds spent converting and publishing this result |
| `message` | Empty on success; the error or skip reason otherwise |
| `report` | The `dutchman.convert/1` result, or null when the input changed during conversion |

For example:

```json
{"schema":"dutchman.watch-event/1","event":"skipped","path":"parts/cube.f3d","elapsed_ms":93,"message":"input changed during conversion","report":null}
```

An existing unrelated destination produces `skipped`; its nested report describes the
staged conversion, while `event` describes publication. Successful reports name the final
output path and are also saved as `<stem>.report.json`; failed reports are saved as
`<stem>.failed.json`, always under the output folder. Reports include `elapsed_ms`.
Ignored files, unsettled uploads and previously recorded hashes emit no event.
The private `.dutchman-watch.json` state has schema `dutchman.watch-state/1`, an `inbox`
identity, `files` mapping relative paths to SHA-256 hashes to `{ "outcome": ... }`, and
`owned` mapping relative output paths to `{ "sha256": "...", "input": "..." }`.
The ownership input is relative to the inbox; numbered `.prt.N` saves share the base `.prt`
owner. Outputs belonging to another input are protected. It is not a conversion report.
Watcher events and state contain paths; keep them private like batch journals.

Unused construction helpers have `history.features[].status: "not_needed"` and an Info
loss `helper not converted: nothing uses it`. Helper Info notes remain present when another
feature or a replay mismatch flattens the history. A used datum whose placement is already
resolved in its dependent sketch, pattern, or datum also has status `not_needed`. Used helpers
that cannot be resolved keep status `blocked` and a specific `reason`. These statuses
measure mapping eligibility; `mode` and `verification` still determine whether history
was written and replayed successfully.

Partial history adds `mode: "partial_history"` and `verification.status: "partial"` within the
existing schema; existing values retain their meanings. `history.rebuilt` counts retained
source features marked `mapped`, and `history.mapped` those marked `mapped` or `not_needed`,
not mapping eligibility after the blocker.
Later body-building features have status `blocked` and a reason saying they follow the
blocker. Resolved later sketches can still be `mapped`. Counts exclude suppressed features.
Orphan sketches without source feature rows are retained but do not increase source feature
counts. An assembly with partial component history also reports `partial_history` / `partial`;
the reason identifies each affected part. Hidden bodies are included in SolidCraft's numeric
evaluation, so evaluating the whole saved design is not a visible-body comparison.

Assembly visibility reports count source-hidden placements separately from retained
editable history. An Info `visibility` note, `N editable-history component placement(s)
are placed hidden`, counts the latter across repeated and nested placements. Both use
the same bounded hidden-occurrence paths; a Degraded note reports paths left shown
past the 4096-path limit.

Assembly placement validation uses the existing `losses` and `completeness` fields.
No placement-specific schema fields are added. An Info loss with subject `placements`
says `N occurrence(s) placed by a reflection were written with a mirrored copy of their
component`; the count covers occurrence records in the written component definitions.
Mirrored definitions share reflected geometry and keep imported geometry only; a Degraded
`history` loss explains discarded history, and a Dropped `joints` loss explains joints
touching mirrored components. Non-finite, scaled, or sheared placements outside the 1e-6
orthogonality/determinant tolerance produce Dropped `placements` losses with a zero-based
occurrence index local to the containing assembly, name, and kind. They are excluded from
`completeness.placed` and counted in `completeness.left_out` at stage `write`. Tiny numeric
drift is re-orthonormalised before writing.

### DXF pages (additive to `dutchman.convert/1`)

`convert --to dxf --json` adds `pages`, in source page order. Each entry has
`name` (FreeCAD object name), `path`, `format` (`dxf/AC1015`), `units` (`mm`),
`entities_per_layer` (a map including empty declared layers),
`dimension_representation` (`lines_and_text` when all visible dimensions are written,
`partial_lines_and_text` when some have only text or are omitted, `text_only`
when all dimensions have labels but no lines, `partial_text_only` when some labels
are omitted and none have lines, `omitted_missing_ir` when none can be written,
or `none` when the page has no visible dimension), and
`losses` with the same fields as conversion losses. Info notes describe kept content;
Degraded notes describe presentation changes; Dropped notes name unavailable view,
dimension and template content and unmapped metadata/resources. IR gaps use
`stage: "project"`, `upstream: "cadmpeg"`; writer omissions use `stage: "map"`. The top-level
`losses` includes every page's mapping losses prefixed by page name, plus decode
and unassigned-object losses. `output.path` names the first page and `output.format`
is `dxf/AC1015`; consumers must use `pages` to find every output. Failures use the
existing error envelope and write no page results. Publication I/O failures can
leave already-written pages on disk.

`dutchman.formats/1` adds `drawings`, an array of drawing capabilities with `input`,
`name`, `output` and `converts`; `input` uses the existing native format id
(`freecad_document`). The FreeCAD TechDraw entry describes DXF
page output and its reported limitations. Existing `formats` fields keep their meaning.

## `dutchman.diagnostics/1`

Live diagnostics are opt-in on CLI `convert`, `convert-all`, and `watch`, MCP `convert`
and `convert_all`, and the desktop app. See [locations and sharing](troubleshooting.md#diagnostic-logs-for-unfinished-runs).
`--diagnostics-default` creates a unique UTC timestamp file in the platform's diagnostic
folder, retaining 50 logs, including legacy time-only names. Automatic names include the
Dutchman version and `running`, then change to `converted`, `failed` or `stopped` after all
writers close. A crash or rename failure leaves `running`; a rename failure never changes
the conversion result. `--diagnostics PATH` appends to an explicit file without retention
or renaming. Reusing an older version's log gives an advisory version notice.
MCP uses `diagnostics_default: true` or `diagnostics: "/absolute/path/run.jsonl"`.

Each line is one JSON object. Common fields are `schema: "dutchman.diagnostics/1"`,
`type`, `file` (the anonymous report's salted file id), and `elapsed_ms` since that
conversion's start. A batch/watch log interleaves conversions; group by `file` and each
`start`/`end` pair. Repeated conversions of one file can reuse its id within a run.

| `type` | Other fields |
|---|---|
| `start` | `dutchman` version; `cadmpeg` version and pinned revision; `os: {family, name, version}`; `cpu_count`; `total_memory_bytes`; `available_memory_bytes`; `choices` (the shared preset/history/sketches/joints choices object); `threads` (chosen concurrent conversions); `input: {format, size_bytes}`; `members` (Fusion ZIP member list, or null). |
| `stage` | `stage`: `input`, `decode`, `project`, `map`, `write`, or `solidcraft`. Written when the stage changes, including the initial stage. |
| `design` | `count` of successful designs read and `total` (null while unknown). Written when these counts change. |
| `heartbeat` | `stage`; `rss_bytes`; `cpu_ticks` (process user + system CPU ticks); `cpu_ticks_per_second`; `cpu_ms` (derived process CPU time); `member` (last started member id, or null). Every 30 seconds from an independent timer. Linux reads `/proc`; unavailable resource measurements are null. Windows and macOS use sysinfo; their CPU ticks are milliseconds (`cpu_ticks_per_second`: 1000). |
| `member` | `member` (salted id); `event`: `start`, `finish`, or `fail`; `ms` (0 at start, duration at finish/failure); `code` (fixed decoder error category on failure, else null). |
| `member_classified` | `member` (the same salted id as member rows); `ms` (total preparation duration); `nested_scan_ms` (member expansion and nested scanning); `layers_ms` (layer classification and merging); `metadata_ms` (reference metadata extraction). All durations are milliseconds. |
| `phase` | `phase` (fixed category); `event`: `start` or `finish`; `ms` (0 at start, elapsed duration at finish); `bytes` (source container length, not inflated bytes). |
| `end` | `error` (anonymous failure facts, or null on success); `ok` (boolean); `stage` last reached; `losses` (code-to-count object); `repeated_losses` (total extra occurrences of identical losses); `member_decodes` (member-id-to-start-count object); `redecoded` (sum of starts after each member's first start). |

`end.error` contains `stage` (failure stage, or null if unavailable), `kind` (fixed error
category, or `other`), `findings` (cadmpeg check-code counts), and `curve_kinds` (counts of
referenced carriers for parameter-domain, carrier-reachability, and geometry-consistency
errors). Only error/blocking findings count. Curve categories are `procedural`, `nurbs`,
`analytic`, `other`, and `unavailable`. Each carrier counts once per finding; counts are
empty when no structured reference can be resolved. These fields contain no finding text,
entity ids, names, paths, or geometry values. CLI/MCP JSON errors from the conversion core
also add `kind` and, for check failures, `findings` and `curve_kinds`; their existing
`message` stays private. Other failures use diagnostic kind `other`.
Model check failures have failure stage `project`, independently of the last progress stage.

Phase categories are `codec_selection`, `container_prepare` (codec entry to the first
member start), `archive_scan`, `archive_classify` and `archive_session_open` (the steps of a
Fusion archive's preparation, inside `container_prepare`), `container_compose` (between member attempts and after the last one), and
`model_validation` (including any geometry-only recheck). Without member callbacks,
`container_prepare` covers the whole codec call. A finish closes the timed scope, including
error returns; it does not claim success. Start records identify a phase even if the
process is killed before it finishes. During `archive_classify`, one `member_classified`
record identifies each classified F3D member, including unreachable members, before the
first member decode starts. Its fixed timing fields separate nested scanning, layer work,
and metadata extraction without exposing the member path. Durations include completed
work before a refusal; a classification record does not claim success. Classification
records are capped at 100,000 per conversion.

Each `members` entry is `{id, compressed_bytes, uncompressed_bytes, nested_content_bytes}`.
The last value is the sum of a nested design archive's declared uncompressed content sizes,
or null when unavailable or beyond the bounded metadata-read budget (64 MiB total).
Directories and metadata entries are included with anonymous ids. Archive directories are
bounded to 10,000 members and the existing memory estimator's directory size limits.

Per-member records appear when the decoder reports them. The pinned Fusion decoder reports
actual `.f3z` member decode attempts, including re-decodes during composition; these are
not unique design completion counts. Error categories are `wrong_format`, `malformed`,
`invalid_input`, `truncated`, `resource_limit`, `unsupported_dialect`, `unsupported_target`,
`insufficient_depth`, `not_implemented`, `io`, or `other`. They contain no exception text.
`member_decodes` tracks at most 100,000 distinct ids per conversion.

```json
{"schema":"dutchman.diagnostics/1","type":"member","file":"f0123456789abcdef","elapsed_ms":245,"member":"fabcdef0123456789","event":"fail","ms":23,"code":"resource_limit"}
{"schema":"dutchman.diagnostics/1","type":"end","file":"f0123456789abcdef","elapsed_ms":246,"ok":false,"stage":"decode","losses":{},"repeated_losses":0,"member_decodes":{"fabcdef0123456789":2},"redecoded":1}
```

Names, paths, geometry, file contents, messages, and the salt are never written. Loss codes
use the same generic code/subject mapping as [report-anon](report-anon.md); messages are
used only in memory to count repeated identical losses. A combined anonymous report and
diagnostic log share the run's salt and file ids. Member ids use that same derivation on
literal member paths without resolving them on the host filesystem, so the `start` list,
member events, and heartbeats agree.

Every record is appended and flushed as it occurs. `sync_data()` runs at least every five
seconds, at start/end, and on stage changes. Complete lines remain readable after a kill;
ignore a trailing incomplete line. A missing `end` means that conversion did not finish
reporting. A supervised worker's timeout/cancellation writes an error `end` if its parent
is still alive. Fields may be added within this schema version.

Default diagnostic filenames use UTC, computed from `SystemTime` without a subprocess.
Start-record OS and total-memory metadata are collected only with diagnostics enabled.
On Windows `os.version` is `"windows"`. Windows and macOS read total and available memory
through sysinfo without launching a memory-probe command. Linux reads `/proc` and caps
available memory by remaining cgroup headroom, including ancestor limits. Memory-budget
refusals happen before decode, never at `map`; Standard accepts the history-free estimate
when it fits.

## `dutchman.diagnose/1`

`dutchman diagnose INPUT [--out FOLDER] [--time-limit T] [--memory-limit GB] [--json]` writes
`FOLDER/diagnose/report.json` in this schema, rewriting it after each part so an interrupted run
keeps its results. An existing `diagnose` folder is refused. Every field is a number, a fixed
category or a code; the report holds no name, path, identity, message or geometry, and is safe
to share. See [Find what breaks in a large private file](diagnose.md).

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema` | `dutchman.diagnose/1`. |
| `versions` | `dutchman` release and `cadmpeg` version. |
| `input` | `format` (Dutchman's format id) and `size_class` (as in `dutchman.repro/1`). |
| `status` | `running` (in progress, or interrupted), `complete`, or `read_failed` (the design could not be read, so no part was tried). |
| `limits` | `time_limit_s` per part and `memory_limit_mb` (null for none). |
| `read` | How reading the design went: `outcome` (`ok`, `failed`, or null while reading), `time_ms`, `peak_memory_mb`, and, if it failed, `stage`, `error_kind` and `findings`. |
| `summary` | Counts: `parts`, `finished`, `ok`, `failed`, `timed_out`, `out_of_memory`, `container`, `not_run`, `restarts` (how often the design was read again after a part stopped the converter) and `elapsed_ms`. |
| `parts` | Every part, ranked: failures first (slowest first), then parts not run, then parts that converted (slowest first, biggest first among equals), then sub-assemblies with nothing of their own. |
| `advice` | Fixed next steps: `{"code": "convert_part", "part": N}`, `{"code": "repro", "part": N}`, `every_part_converts` or `read_failed`. |

Each of `parts`:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `rank` | Position in this ranking, from 1. |
| `part` | The part's number, from 1: the number `dutchman convert --part` takes and `dutchman repro` uses. |
| `parent` | The number of the sub-assembly holding it, or null. |
| `kind` | `part`, or `assembly` for a sub-assembly. |
| `depth` | How many sub-assemblies it sits inside. |
| `outcome` | `ok`, `failed`, `timed_out`, `out_of_memory`, `container` (a sub-assembly, or a component, with no geometry of its own: nothing to convert), or `not_run` (given up after too many restarts, or the run was stopped). |
| `stage` | The stage it stopped at (`map`, `write`, ...), or null. A part stopped for time or memory is at `map`. |
| `error_kind` | A fixed category such as `restate`, `encode`, `cadmpeg_checks`, `no_geometry`, `panic` or `crash`, or null. |
| `findings`, `curve_kinds` | cadmpeg check codes with counts, and referenced curve categories, as in `dutchman.repro/1`. |
| `time_ms` | How long the part took (until it was stopped, if it was). |
| `peak_memory_mb`, `extra_memory_mb` | The most memory the converter held while on the part, and how much of that came on top of what it held before the part. |
| `bodies`, `entities` | Size: bodies, and all the entities (faces, edges, features, sketches and the rest) the part holds. |

`FOLDER/diagnose/local-key.json` uses `dutchman.diagnose-local/1`, with `warning` and the
private `input` path and each `parts` entry's `part` number and `name`. It must stay local, and
is written readable by its owner only.

The `--json` result also uses `dutchman.diagnose/1` with `ok`, `summary` (text), `status`,
`paths` (`report`, `text`, `local_key`), `share` and `private` (which files are which) and
`report` (the content of `report.json`). It holds local paths and stays local.

`dutchman convert --part N` and the part-stop message of a conversion that cannot fit in memory
use the same numbers.

## `dutchman.narrow/1`

`dutchman diagnose --narrow INPUT [--out FOLDER] [--time-limit T] [--memory-limit GB]
[--step-time-limit T] [--json]` writes `FOLDER/diagnose/narrow.json` in this schema when it
finishes. Every field is a number, a fixed category or a code, and the file is safe to share. See
[Let Dutchman do all of it](diagnose.md#let-dutchman-do-all-of-it---narrow).

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema` | `dutchman.narrow/1`. |
| `versions` | `dutchman` release and `cadmpeg` version. |
| `status` | `narrowed`, `read_failed` (the design could not be read), `not_repeated` (parts failed in the ranking, and none failed again), `nothing_to_narrow` (every part and the whole design converted) or `stopped` (a step ran past its limit). |
| `parts`, `failing_parts` | How many parts the design has, and how many failed in the ranking. |
| `part` | The number of the part narrowed to, or null. |
| `scope` | Where it fails: `alone`, `neighbours` (only with the parts either side of it) or `design` (only in the whole design); null when no failure was isolated. |
| `features` | How many features the part's history has (those not suppressed), or null. |
| `first_failing_feature` | The first feature it fails at, from 1, in timeline order: its history up to there fails the same way and its history up to the one before does not. Null when no feature was found. |
| `bracket` | When the bisection ran past its limit: `passes` and `fails`, the feature numbers it had got to. Otherwise null. |
| `stored_shape` | True when the part fails with no history at all, so the failure is in its stored shape. |
| `stopped_at_step` | The step that ran past its limit, or null. |
| `trials` | How many tries it took, across resumes. |
| `signature` | The failure's signature ([`dutchman.signature/1`](#dutchmansignature1)), or null. |

Exit code 0 for `narrowed`, `read_failed` and `nothing_to_narrow`, 1 for `not_repeated` and
`stopped` and for a run that could not go on. The `--json` result uses the same schema with `ok`,
`status`, `summary` (text), `paths` (`result`, `state`, `report`, and with a signature
`signature`, `anonymous`, `next_steps`) and `result` (the content of `narrow.json`). It holds
local paths and stays local.

`FOLDER/diagnose/narrow-state.json` (`dutchman.narrow-state/1`) is the checkpoint a stopped run
resumes from. Its fields are internal and may change with a release. It holds numbers, fixed
categories and the size and SHA-256 of the input, and no names or paths. `local-key.json` gains
`feature` (`part`, `number` and the private `name`).

## `dutchman.signature/1`

`FOLDER/diagnose/signature.json`, and `narrowing.signature` in `kit/anonymous.json`. It says what
kind of thing failed and how. Every value is a fixed category or a count of loops: it holds no
name, path, identity or dimension, and is safe to share. The type is
`dutchman::diagnose::signature::Signature`.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema` | `dutchman.signature/1`. |
| `hash` | The SHA-256, in lowercase hex, of the signature's text form below. Two signatures with the same hash are the same signature. |
| `error.outcome` | `failed`, `timed_out` or `out_of_memory`. |
| `error.stage` | The stage it stopped at, or null. |
| `error.kind` | The error's fixed category (`restate`, `encode`, `cadmpeg_checks`, `panic`, `crash`...), or null. |
| `error.codes` | The check-finding codes, sorted, without counts. |
| `feature` | The feature the failure was narrowed to, or null. |
| `feature.kind` | Its operation (`extrude`, `fillet`, `hole`...). |
| `feature.options` | The choices made in it, by option: `op`, `direction`, `start`, `extent`, `end`, `first_end`, `second_end`, `inner_wire_taper`, `pattern`, `family`, `type`, `solid`, `refine`, `draft` (`yes` when it has one). Each only where the feature has it. A feature in its source program's native form has none. |
| `feature.profile` | For a feature with a profile: `source` (what it is made from), `loops`, `inner_loops` (how many sit inside another; null when that cannot be told), `curves` (the kinds of curve in it, sorted). |

The text form is the schema, then one `field=value` line for each of `outcome`, `stage`, `kind`,
`codes` (joined with commas), and, with a feature, `feature`, each `option.<name>` in name order,
and, with a profile, `profile.source`, `profile.loops`, `profile.inner_loops` and `profile.curves`.
An absent value is empty. A change to this form is a new schema version.

## `dutchman.same-failure/1`

`dutchman diagnose --same-failure SMALL --out FOLDER [--json]` compares a small rebuilt file with
the signature in `FOLDER`. It exits 0 only when `verdict` is `same`.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema` | `dutchman.same-failure/1`. |
| `ok` | True when the comparison ran. |
| `verdict` | `same`, `converts_fine`, `different` or `too_broad` (same stage and category, with no feature or check code to prove it the same failure). |
| `same` | True when `verdict` is `same`. |
| `differs` | For `different`: the fields that differ, from `outcome`, `stage`, `kind`, `codes`, `feature`, `options`, `profile`. |
| `expected`, `got` | The two signatures; `got` is null when the file converts. |
| `summary` | What to do next, in words. |

`FOLDER/diagnose/same-failure.json` keeps the verdict, with `small_file` (size and SHA-256) so
that `--make-report` knows which file passed.

## `dutchman.made-report/1`

`dutchman diagnose --make-report SMALL --out FOLDER [--json]` sends nothing. It refuses a file
that has not passed `--same-failure` (`same` or `too_broad`), and the original design.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema` | `dutchman.made-report/1`. |
| `ok` | True. |
| `summary` | What was made, in words. |
| `paths` | `zip` (`dutchman-report.zip`, holding `anonymous.json`, `signature.json` and the small file as `small.<extension>`) and `issue_link` (`issue-link.txt`). Local paths. |
| `issue_url` | The link that opens the GitHub issue form filled in. It carries the format, versions, system, the signature's short hash, stage and error kind, and no file. |
| `private_send` | `text` and `url`: how to send the zip without GitHub. |
| `signature` | The signature's hash. |

## `dutchman.repro/1`

`dutchman repro INPUT --out FOLDER [--json]` and the MCP `repro` tool write a local kit.
An existing `FOLDER/kit` is refused. Temporary conversion output and diagnostics live in a
random temporary directory under `FOLDER` and are removed when the call returns normally,
including on errors. A killed process can leave that directory behind; keep it private.
The command performs the default SolidCraft conversion and its normal checks and recovery.
It makes no network requests.

`kit/anonymous.json` is the shareable artifact. It is built from fixed categories and
counts, using the diagnostic log's allowlist for the failure object. It contains no source
names, paths, entity identities, file hashes, geometry, parameter values, raw messages,
exact input byte lengths, or timings.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema` | `dutchman.repro/1`. |
| `versions` | `dutchman` release and pinned `cadmpeg` version plus commit. |
| `input.format` | Stable Dutchman format id, or null. |
| `input.size_class` | `under_1_mib`, `1_to_16_mib`, `16_to_256_mib`, `256_mib_or_more`, or null if unavailable. Boundaries are powers of two. |
| `status` | `failure` or `no_failure_to_reproduce`. A recovered conversion is a success. |
| `failure` | Null on success; otherwise fixed `stage`, `kind`, error `findings` by code and referenced `curve_kinds` by category, as in diagnostics. Counts describe the original failure. |
| `narrowing.members` | Independent F3Z member trials with one-based `ordinal`, `total`, fixed `status` (`decoded` or `decode_failed`) and `trial_failure` (anonymous stage/category/check facts, or null). Includes tested members only. |
| `narrowing.path` | Ordered steps with `unit` (`part`, `member`, `component`, `occurrence`, `body`, `feature`, `sketch`), one-based `ordinal` and `total`, and for a `feature` its `kind` (a fixed category). `part` is the first step when the kit followed a [`dutchman diagnose`](diagnose.md) report, and its ordinal is diagnose's part number. Each step is scoped to the previously retained unit. |
| `narrowing.from_diagnose` | True when the kit went straight to the failing part of a diagnose report (found in `--out`, or given with `--from-diagnose`). |
| `narrowing.smallest_failing_unit_isolated` | True when a single body or smaller independent feature/sketch subset retained the same stage, category and complete finding-code set. Does not prove the globally smallest model or identify the native operation responsible. |
| `narrowing.signature` | The failure's [signature](#dutchmansignature1) in a kit `dutchman diagnose --narrow` wrote; null in a `dutchman repro` kit. |
| `narrowing.limits` | Fixed explanatory sentences for unavailable levels, unsuccessful trials or a trial budget. |
| `retained_unit_kinds` | Null when no checked subset is available; otherwise `surface_kinds`, `feature_kinds` (fixed enum categories; unlisted kinds become `other`), `finding_entity_kinds` (arena names cited by structured errors, or null when unavailable), and `use_curve_outside_carrier` (structurally detected coedge range/carrier-domain mismatch count). Counts cover the retained unit, without carrier values. |

For model check failures, only cadmpeg's checks run again on the retained model. The full
code set must match; counts may decrease. For F3Z, cadmpeg's bounded independent-member
session decodes members before testing their models. Then dependency-closed component,
occurrence, body, feature and sketch subsets are tried in arena order. Dependencies are
retained, so a subset may require several bodies or features. A feature referencing the
same final geometry does not isolate the feature that produced the fault. No native
records are edited and feature regeneration is not supported. At most 256 trials and
100,000 entities per subset are considered. Member composition errors and unstructured
decoder/encoder errors have no check-code signature: no isolated unit is claimed for them.
Writer failures are retried on component/body/feature/sketch subsets. Matching only their
stage and category produces candidate steps, with isolation false and an explicit limit;
the broad category alone does not establish equivalent failures. Mapping, restatement and
any replay run together as one writer operation; this API cannot retry them separately.
Unsupported stages are stated in `limits`.

`kit/local-key.json` uses `dutchman.repro-local/1`, with `warning: "Do not share"` and
the private `input` path, `source_document` name (or null), `members` (tested archive ordinals and names), and `ordinals`: selected steps with `unit`, `ordinal`, `total`, `parent_step` (zero-based index
of the preceding scope, or null), `name` (or null) and a local lookup hint. Ordinals use
CADIR arena order; native CAD programs may show a different order. Names come directly
from the source model. This file must stay local.

`kit/next-steps.md` contains fixed recipes chosen by finding code and carrier kinds,
anonymous ordinal lookup instructions, limits, and exactly what may be sent. A recipe
suggests a candidate; the rebuilt design must reproduce the same stage and code set.
Unknown codes get the body-copy/rebuild recipe. Neither instructions nor anonymous JSON
include local-key content.

The CLI `--json` and MCP response envelope also uses `dutchman.repro/1`, with `ok` (kit
creation succeeded), `summary`, `paths` (`anonymous`, `local_key`, `next_steps`), and
`anonymous` (the artifact content). This envelope contains local output paths and stays
local. A conversion failure still has `ok: true` when the kit was written. MCP includes
`local_key` content only with explicit `include_local_key: true`; keep that response local.

## `dutchman.investigate/1`

`dutchman investigate INPUT [--out FOLDER] [--json]` prints one object.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schema` | `dutchman.investigate/1`. |
| `ok` | True when the summary was made. A failure prints the usual failure object instead. |
| `input` | The design, as in `dutchman.convert/1`. |
| `out` | The private folder. |
| `summary_path` | `summary.md`, the one file made to be shared. |
| `report` | Where the conversion report came from: `saved` (beside the design), `given` (`--report`) or `converted` (converted here, into `convert/` in the folder). |
| `narrowed` | Null when the conversion succeeded; else whether narrowing found the first failing feature. |
| `synthetic` | Whether a synthetic case was made (always false in this version). |
| `builds` | Null with `--no-compare`; else one entry per newer build compared: `label` (`nightly` or the candidate's name), `title`, `compared`, `not_compared_because` (local wording, may name local paths), `regresses`, `converts`, `rebuilt`, `better` and `worse` (feature counts). Local only, like the rest of this result. |
| `asked` | Whether the user was asked on the terminal. |
| `sent` | Whether the summary was sent. |
| `receipt` | The receipt id, when it was sent. |
| `send` | The [`dutchman.report-send/1`](#report-preview-and-sending-dutchmanreport-send1) result, when sending was tried. |
| `private` | Files in the folder that are never sent: `local-key.json` (the salt and the design's path), `convert/` and `anonymous.json`. |
| `summary` | One sentence on what happened and what to do next. |

## Recipes and known failures

`dutchman.narrow/1` adds `recipe` (Markdown text, or null without a signature) and
`known_failure` (null or an object with `hash`, `class`, `status`, `message`) to its findings
object, also returned under `result`. Status `known_failure` means an exact shipped match
was found; no further isolation or bisection is needed. `status` in a known-failure record
is `fixed_next_version` or `workaround`. Class is the feature kind, or `generic` without a
feature. Full signature hash and class must both match. Existing checkpoint files remain
readable; a missing `known_failure` is treated as null.

The embedded catalogs use `dutchman.recipes/1` and `dutchman.known-failures/1` and are
versioned independently of signatures. Recipes contain no source dimensions or geometry.

## `dutchman.part-trial/1`

MCP `convert_part` and `stop_at_feature` discard geometry and return `schema`, `ok`,
`part` (one-based), `neighbours` (boolean), `stop_at_feature` (null or a zero-based count
of retained features), `features` (full history length), `converted` (boolean) and
`signature` (null on success, otherwise `dutchman.signature/1`). `ok` means the trial ran,
including a conversion failure; `converted` tells whether conversion succeeded.

The anonymous diagnostic MCP tools omit local `paths` from the existing CLI reports.
On an argument or I/O error, they return `ok: false`, null input, and a fixed anonymous
message in the corresponding schema, so even error responses do not reveal source names.

## `dutchman.doctor/1` and `dutchman.compare-step/1`

`doctor` writes and returns an anonymous report. `ok` means orchestration completed
without planning or checkpoint errors, not that every conversion succeeded or all
checks passed. `files` contains numbered `file`, `converted`, `check_status`,
`target_part`, `placement_checks`, `history_replay` (conversion verification status),
and `step_comparison`. `planning_failed` counts planning errors without names.
`budget` records actual `jobs`, total `memory_bytes` and `per_worker_bytes`.
`advisory: true` requires review. `findings` groups a `dutchman.signature/1` signature,
`count` and numbered `occurrences` (`file`, nullable `part`). A broad signature only
suggests related failures. Checkpoints contain private conversion results and paths;
only the top-level `report.json` is intended for sharing.

Each doctor file also has nullable `completeness`, containing numeric `placed`,
`placed_empty`, `placements`, and `left_out` (the number left out, without names or
reasons). Empty placements add a finding with outcome `degraded`, stage `map`, kind
`no_geometry`, and code `empty_placements`. Solid regions reduced to sheets add a
finding with outcome `degraded`, stage `write`, kind `geometry`, and code
`solid_reduced_to_sheet`. These findings count affected files; placement counts are
in each file's `completeness`.

Diagnose reports add nullable `target_part`, `placement_checks` and `step_comparison`.
Placement checks have `status`, `advisory`, `coincident_transform_tolerance` (1e-9),
`bounds` (explicitly unavailable without an independent source envelope), and numbered
`findings` with `code` (`placement_nonfinite`, `placement_coincident`,
`geometry_untrimmed_torus`), `part`, and
optional body/placement/other-placement numbers. Coincidence requires the same part
definition. Similar bounds alone do not establish duplicate geometry. Placement
sanity uses joint-solved transforms when joints are kept, and stored transforms
when joints are omitted, matching the conversion.
`geometry_untrimmed_torus` adds numbered `body` and `face` for a toroidal face with
no trim loops in a shell with other faces; a single-face torus shell is allowed.
Assembly findings name the owning extracted part; container copies of its faces
do not produce duplicate findings.

A STEP comparison has `status` (`measured` or `unavailable`), `parts` (body comparisons,
worst first), `advisory`, and numeric `thresholds`. Each row has `body` and
`reference_body` (nullable for unmatched bodies), `matched`, `source` and `reference`
(`volume_mm3`, `area_mm2`, `bbox_mm` as min XYZ then max XYZ, `faces`; missing measures
are null), `differences` (`volume_relative`, `area_relative`, `bbox_max_mm`,
`placement_mm`, `faces`), `status` (`measured`, `incomplete` or `unmatched`), `looks_wrong`, and
`findings`. Codes are `step_volume`, `step_area`, `step_bbox`, `step_placement`, and
`step_unmatched`. Face differences are informational. Placement is the Euclidean
distance between bbox centres. Matching is one-to-one, by geometry with placement and
order breaking ties; it is a heuristic, not proof of identical topology. Evaluated
body numbers differ from diagnose part numbers in assemblies. No names, paths,
CLI messages or geometry bytes are returned. Missing kernel support gives a fixed
recovery message and `unavailable`. A null comparison means no matching export was used.

MCP `compare_step` wraps this as `schema: dutchman.compare-step/1`, `ok`, `comparison`.
MCP diagnose omits local paths; errors from these three local-check tools are anonymous.
Numeric comparison thresholds include `position_ceiling_mm` (0.5), in addition to
`position_floor_mm` (0.1) and `position_diagonal_relative` (0.001). The position
allowance is the diagonal fraction clamped to that floor and ceiling.
See the guide for the thresholds and calibration limits.

Doctor also fills `geometry_checks` with the same measurement structure, comparing
stored source geometry with the converted SolidCraft design, using the conversion's
joint setting for the reference pose. Its finding codes use
`geometry_` instead of `step_`. Partial-history outputs intentionally include extra
hidden editable bodies, so this comparison is skipped for that mode; existing replay
verification still runs. For flagged comparisons, `preview_status` says whether local
SolidCraft snapshots were produced. Preview paths and bytes stay private under the
checkpoint's `diagnose/preview/{step,geometry}/` folders. They show the full design,
not an isolated part. No preview is included in anonymous output or report submission.
BBox coordinates beyond 1e12 mm are treated as unavailable measurements.

### Report preview and sending (`dutchman.report-send/1`)

Preview: `ok`, `report_id` (the diagnostic file id), `source_format`, `signature`,
`parts` (role and uncompressed `bytes`), `bundle_size` (gzip bytes),
`metadata` (the exact anonymous summary envelope with default consent: schema, report id,
app version, OS, source format/app, signature, claim hash and sharing choices),
`bundle_available`, `summary_size` (summary JSON bytes with default consent), `default_choice` (`bundle` when available, otherwise `summary`), `public_test` (false), `summary`.
No contents or claim secret are returned. Sending takes explicit consent and returns
`sent`: true only with a matching Worker `report_id` and unsigned Unix `received`.
Failure returns `sent: false`, `summary`, `local_folder`, optional `bundle`,
`github` and `private_send`. Paths are local, not sent in the multipart request.
The request includes `dutchman_version` (the build version), `source_format`, and
`source_app`, derived from the native format family (Fusion, Inventor, SolidWorks,
FreeCAD, CATIA, Creo, NX, Creo View or Rhino). Exchange formats (STEP, IGES, ACIS),
unclassified `.prt` and unrecognised formats use `unknown`: the authoring app cannot
be inferred from those formats. No file is opened to derive this field.
`signature` may be `converted-with-problem` for a converted result reported as wrong.
There is no free-text description field in this envelope. The CLI `dutchman report`
returns this same preview and supports explicit summary sending; MCP uses `report_preview`
and `report_submit`.
The request records consent choice, text version 1 and public-test permission;
only a claim hash leaves the app. A local `submission.json` freezes that choice for
retries; `prepared.json` holds the private claim secret. Keep both private.

Release details may include `fixes_reports`: lower-case SHA-256 report-id hashes.
The desktop compares locally and shows one fix notice by the update prompt.
There is no per-report status request or contact field. Discord follow-up is optional:
the app copies `claim <id>-<code>` and opens Dutchy's DM on a click.

For GitHub release feeds, append machine-readable release metadata to the release
notes as `<!-- dutchman-release {"fixes_reports":["<64 lower-case hex digits>"]} -->`.
The update check reads that comment in the existing Atom feed, including for package
installations, and hides it from displayed notes. Release JSON may also supply the
same `fixes_reports` array directly. No report ids are sent during update checks.

Desktop report review describes the summary in plain language; this does not change
the report fields or consent values sent to the report service.

Reproduction bundles use `dutchman.repro-bundle/1` for local extraction refusal and
verification results. Extraction of a proven bundle returns the existing report-send
preview. Diagnose and narrow results add `bundle` (a preview, unavailable result, or
null). Doctor checkpoints add the same field. These previews include `manifest`, an
array of `{arena, rows, serialized_bytes, description}`, plus `bundle_sendable` and
`private_send`. `parts` describes saved payload roles and uncompressed byte sizes;
`bundle_size` is the gzip byte size. `default_choice` is `bundle` when available,
otherwise `summary`. `request_size` includes multipart framing and metadata (default
public-test permission false), `request_limit` is 25 MiB, and `bundle_limit` reserves
64 KiB below it. `bundle_sendable` requires both limits to fit. Oversize bundles stay
local for the private-send card; summaries remain available.

Verification returns `reproduces`, `signature` (hash only), `manifest`,
`compressed_bytes`, and `uncompressed_bytes`. Bundle contents and local paths are never
returned. The gzip contains a CADIR fragment with cadmpeg's reproduction contract and
opaque context keys `dutchman_part`, `feature_index`, and `failed_operation_kind`;
unknown context values are null. Keep the gzip and prepared metadata private.

Cut refusals (including the fragment byte limit) return `ok: true` and
`bundle_available: false`, with a plain `summary` and `private_send`; no bundle is saved.

### Appearance loss codes

Dropped appearance assignments use `dutchman/appearance.wire` (wire body or saved free
edge), `dutchman/appearance.face-pick-missed` (face geometry has no resolved output pick),
`dutchman/appearance.target-absent` (target absent from the decoded model),
`dutchman/appearance.unwritable-body` (body cannot be written), or
`dutchman/appearance.other` (other mapping gaps). `dutchman/appearance.redundant-face`
is reserved for face colours equal to their body colour; these are retained and have no
loss count. Kept assignments never produce dropped appearance losses.

These fixed categories reach both `dutchman.report-anon/1` loss counts and
`dutchman.diagnostics/1` `end.losses`. Anonymous appearance entries omit `example` and
contain no binding or target ids or names. See [the anonymous report](report-anon.md#appearance-loss-causes).
Ordinary conversion losses keep `subject`, `message`, `stage` and `upstream` as before;
Dutchman's appearance codes have `stage: "map"` and `upstream: null`.
